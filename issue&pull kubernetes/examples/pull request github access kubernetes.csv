The container that exclusively copies a war file into place does not have to continue running after its job is done.  Therefore using an init-container allows the container with the war file to run, copy its payload into place & then terminate.

Also, using an init-container ensures that the copying of the payload _must_ complete _before_ the Tomcat container can start.  This removes the chance for a race condition (however unlikely) in which Tomcat starts before the war file is copied in place.",['idvoretskyi'],3,2018-09-06 20:34:16,2018-09-07 14:50:19,2018-09-07 14:50:19,True,2018-09-07 14:50:19,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed
