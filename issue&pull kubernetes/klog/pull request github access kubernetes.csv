```
type Verbose struct {
	enabled bool
	logr    logr.InfoLogger
}
```

Consequently, it requires a corresponding change in k/k in the instances where `if klog.V(x) {` (replacing them with `if klog.V(x).Enabled()`).

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
This should be a good short term solution, making it a configurable flag would require initializing the flushDaemon somewhere else (maybe a different Init function?). Given that it seems most users set the value to 5s, I thought making that the default would be a good first step.

Adds 6 unit tests to cover some basic functionality of klogr's structured output handling.

I created these tests as I've noticed a bug in the 'deduplication' handling when multiple kv pairs with the same key are specified.

```

```

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

~The `should_print_duplicate_keys_with_different_values_when_all_values_are_passed_to_Info` test is failing - should I fix the actual implementation as part of this PR?~

~As you can see, the 2nd value is *always* set even if the two tuples have different values: `\""akey\""=\""avalue2\"" \""akey\""=\""avalue2\""` (notice that `avalue2` is set twice)~

I've updated this PR to include handling of duplicate key/value tuples as well, so all the tests should now pass ðŸ˜„

klog shouldn't erase old log files when components restart,
and should also ensure it doesn't overwrite old logs in
existing files when restarts happen.

Previously, files were opened with O_TRUNC at both startup
and rotation time. While, in the latter case, this ensures
a fresh log file, it doesn't make sense in the former case.

We probably don't see this cause issues in many production environments these days because journald is a very popular log sink. @yujuhong also noticed some logs overwritten at the beginning in Windows tests, which may have been caused by klog not opening the files as append-only (to be clear, it seems that the files on Windows weren't truncated correctly either, which requires further research figure out).

klog,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/klog/pulls/50,https://github.com/kubernetes/klog/pull/50,mtaufen,Revert default changes,"**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Reverts recent, potentially breaking changes to flag defaults. These block vendoring the latest version of klog into upstream Kubernetes, because they could break user deployments of core Kubernetes components. If these changes are eventually included, they need to be included in a way that respects the upstream deprecation policy (see below).

This PR reverts three other PRs:
1. #42, which changes the stderrthreshold default to INFO
    - This could cause significant, unexpected increases in logging verbosity.
2. ~#39, which changes the logtostderr default to true~
    - ~This, especially, could break existing logging configurations because when set, it disables logs from being sent to files, even if --log_file is set.~ EDIT: See below conversation, we decided to keep #39 due to pre-existing overrides in k/k, but still revert the other two.
3. #31, which conditions tostderr output on stderrthreshold
    - Without the addition of #42, this could have resulted in default behavior that silently drops (Info) logs sent to stderr when logtostderr is true. With the revert of #42, this should also be reverted.

Adding these changes back in can be revisited and discussed during code slush, but I would like to back them out in order to get the O_APPEND fix into Kubernetes 1.14.

If we decide to include these changes in upstream Kubernetes, we need to follow the official policy of announcing deprecation of old defaults and waiting the appropriate amount of time before changing them: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/. In the future, we need to figure out how to more carefully coordinate changes to defaults in this repo with deprecation policies of other Kubernetes projects.
