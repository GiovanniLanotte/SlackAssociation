Which became: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/899

there are lots of details to think about with governance. In my view the bootstrap committee is laying the ground work to seed a steering committee, but this steering committee will need to create ""bylaws"" which will explain:

- the membership ( and process to navigate this membership)
- the election process for the steering committee -DONE
- discussion, voting processes throughout the projects (how are decisions made)
- where the community lives (do we expect all members of standing to be on slack ? which channel ?)
- the incubator (we need a committee there to vote on graduation and incubation)
- the governance of the sigs 

When that is in place the adequate membership can discuss and vote on mechanisms to take technical decisions...",['spiffxp'],1,2017-08-20 13:31:43,2017-12-14 22:57:40,2017-12-14 22:57:40,False,,,dirty,False,closed
