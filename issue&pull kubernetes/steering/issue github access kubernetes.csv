Which became: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/899

there are lots of details to think about with governance. In my view the bootstrap committee is laying the ground work to seed a steering committee, but this steering committee will need to create ""bylaws"" which will explain:

- the membership ( and process to navigate this membership)
- the election process for the steering committee -DONE
- discussion, voting processes throughout the projects (how are decisions made)
- where the community lives (do we expect all members of standing to be on slack ? which channel ?)
- the incubator (we need a committee there to vote on graduation and incubation)
- the governance of the sigs

There is an LGPL license for code that is vendored in client-go: https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/vendor/github.com/juju/ratelimit/LICENSE

It appears that this is inherited from the main Kubernetes repository: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/vendor/github.com/juju/ratelimit/LICENSE

Does this not ""infect"" use of the code in this repository in some way? What compatibility is there with the Apache 2.0 license that this repository bears?

steering,jdumars,https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/57,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/steering/issues/57,Kubernetes license scanning,"This comes from an [email to Steering@](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-kubernetes-maintainers/message/61)

Hello Kubernetes maintainers,

I'm running the Linux Foundation's license scanning and analysis services for several LF projects. For CNCF's IP policy and its new license whitelist (approved at the May Governing Board meeting), going forward I'll be running and providing monthly scan reports for CNCF projects, including Kubernetes.

Attached are two spreadsheets showing the license notices found in the kubernetes and kubernetes-client orgs' code repos as of July 3. (Future results will be available through a web interface and in other file formats.) This report shows licenses actually contained in the source code repos, and does not address external dependencies pulled in at build-time or run-time.

Apache-2.0 files are under CNCF's project license, and many of the ""Attribution"" licenses will be auto-approved under CNCF's whitelist policy. For the remainder, I'll work with CNCF's IP Committee to review and discuss recommending approvals by the Governing Board.

In preparation for that, I have a few questions for you, focusing on the key findings. If you'd prefer that I submit issues in Github for these, I'm happy to do so -- just let me know. But for #1 and #2 in particular I wanted to raise these first with the maintainer list, in light of the particular license issues.

1) The component github.com/heketi/heketi is used in four repos. Heketi uses a mix of licenses, but the main issue is that files in heketi/pkg/utils/ can only be used under LGPL-3.0 or GPL-2.0, both of which are likely problematic here. Can the files in heketi/pkg/utils/ be removed, or replaced with an alternative library under a more permissive license?
The repos are: kubernetes, minikube, autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler, and contrib/rescheduler

2) There are GPL-2.0 LICENSE text files in the github.com/docker/docker component, within the contrib/selinux-* subfolders in four repos. There is no corresponding code in these directories. Can these directories and LICENSE files be removed?
The repos are: cloud-provider-aws, federation, kops and test-infra

3) The component github.com/juju/ratelimit is under LGPL-3.0 with a linking exception. It was replaced in the main kubernetes repo in #38320 to use golang.org/x/time/rate instead. juju/ratelimit is still present in several other kubernetes repos; can these be similarly updated to the alternate library?
The repos are: autoscaler/addon-resizer, contrib (in diurnal, docker-micro-benchmark, election, keepalived-vip, scale-demo and service-loadbalancer), dashboard, dns, federation, frakti, heapster, kompose, kube-deploy, node-problem-detector, perf-tests, and test-infra.

4) The component gopkg.in/yaml.v2 used to have the same LGPL-3.0 license, but has now been updated in the kubernetes repo to a newer version with Apache-2.0. Several other repos still use the old version under LGPL-3.0; can these also be updated?
The repos are: autoscaler/addon-resizer, contrib (in diurnal, docker-micro-benchmark, election, keepalived-vip, podex, scale-demo and service-loadbalancer), dashboard, federation, heapster, kube-deploy, node-problem-detector, perf-tests, publishing-bot and test-infra.

5) In minikube, there is a config file which states that it is part of systemd and is under LGPL-2.1. Most of the file is commented out. Is it necessary to distribute this file, or could it be obtained by the downstream user separately (along with systemd, which I assume we aren't distributing)?

6) In kops, /hooks/nvidia-bootstrap/README.md says that ""Using this hook indicates that you agree to"" a non-OSS license from NVIDIA. Is this intended to refer to software separately installed by the Dockerfile, rather than code in the kops repo itself? If so, I may propose a tweak to the language here.

7) In the translations/ folder in kubernetes, there are 12 files stating that ""This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package."" (e.g., here) Can these be corrected to refer to Kubernetes specifically?

8) In the kubernetes-client javascript repo, a package.json file was added stating that the kubernetes-client-typescript package is under the Unlicense. Can this be corrected to Apache-2.0?

Going forward I will likely have other suggestions and questions around licenses, but those above will help me to prepare Kubernetes for review and approval by the IP Committee / GB.

Thanks again for all your help, and please let me know if you have any questions. Best,
Steve

steering,caniszczyk,https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/84,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/steering/issues/84,CNCF dev rep from the KSC,"Kubernetes Steering Committee:

You will recall that the CNCF governing board (GB) created 2 developer seats in 2017, one to be filled by a Kubernetes Steering Committee (KSC) member and one to be elected from the other (non-sandbox) CNCF-hosted projects. Details are here: https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/gb-developer-reps.md

Starting from the December 2017 GB meeting, Michelle Noorali was picked to represent the KSC (with a 1-year term) and Brandon Philips (based on being a CNI maintainer, not due to his KSC position) was elected for the other seat (with a 2-year term). The CNCF GB reviewed this process at its meeting this month and is not proposing any changes.

So, we request that the KSC reappoint Michelle or replace her, this time for a 2-year term. 

Thanks, and please let me know if you have any questions.",closed,False,2018-11-23 01:52:29,2018-12-26 15:11:05

steering,spiffxp,https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/86,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/steering/issues/86,Questions around some charter scope specifics,"This came up during yesterday's SIG Release meeting.  They were looking for some clarification around:

>- Decide how and when official releases of Kubernetes artifacts are made and what they include
>- Declare a release, so that the committee can ensure quality/feature/other requirements are met.

Thus far it appears as though the steering committee has not been actively involved in either of these.  

My canned response was that we have been comfortable with SIG Release owning this from an execution perspective, and putting steering on the critical path would dramatically bottleneck us.  If it came down to changing the release process, or changing the definition of what a release includes, I would view steering as the escalation point of last resort, but would hope that SIG Release and SIG Architecture could work this out themselves.

(There are a number of other points where we have effectively delegated to other groups, and are merely around as escalation point of last resort.  But we haven't exhaustively listed this out, presumably because it's implied we're the escalation point of last resort for everything?)

For the purposes of scoping this issue, I'm interested in just these two release points.  Do we still need these points on our charter, do they need to be refined, or can they be dropped?

The product security team was formed to handle disclosures to security@kubernetes.io and document disclosure processes at kubernetes.io/security.

For the last 1.5 years it has been operating as a nebulous team as part of SIG Release which was the recommendation of the steering committee at the time. Today though, we have a [committee creation process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md#committees).

We don't have a systematic way to identify, advertise, and fill areas that need to be staffed across the project, except in a few areas, such as the release team.

There are at least 3 areas:
1. Work within SIGs and committees. This is why we created the role board. But most SIGs haven't defined roles. Developing some suggested roles may help.
2. Identifying which SIGs most need help. We've done this sporadically, with SIG UI, SIG Docs, and a few other areas, but don't have a systematic way of surfacing these needs.
3. Areas that fall outside the SIGs. We're trying to minimize such areas, but some still exist. The K8s Infra WG is a recent example of an effort to move something forward that doesn't cleanly fall under any particular SIG.
