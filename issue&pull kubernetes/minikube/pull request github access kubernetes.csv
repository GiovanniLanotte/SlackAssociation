2. Rename all refs to `github.com/kubernetes` to `k8s.io` as the main project
3. Update the readme with new formatting and information
4. Run `gofmt -s -w .`. There were two files too in vendor, but I excluded them from the commit.
5. Update the copyright year to 2016
6. Update cobra `Use: ""cli""` to `Use: ""minikube""` and some various formatting
7. Add a `test.sh` script that runs both unit and integration tests

The plan is currently to deprecate localkube as it's own project and focus our development efforts on minikube.

We continued using Godeps to vendor the dependencies though I am very interested in switching to Glide. In the short time I've spent maintaining localkube have found managing Kubernetes as a dependency can be challenging with Godeps.

While I added compiling the localkube binary to the build script, the minikube cli still uses the Redspread bundled version of localkube (#15).

A ported version of kube2sky is being used here as the original package does not allow external access. I am highly in favor moving to a centrally maintained when that becomes available, there is a PR in to open up access (kubernetes/kubernetes#25061).

Do you know of a better way to run a single conformance test? It looks like the quoting in here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/ginkgo-e2e.sh#L109

causes trouble with spaces. If I echo the final command, like:

`echo ""${ginkgo}"" ""${ginkgo_args[@]:+${ginkgo_args[@]}}"" ""${e2e_test}"" -- \
  ""${auth_config[@]:+${auth_config[@]}}"" \
  --host=""${KUBE_MASTER_URL}"" \

  --cluster-tag=""${CLUSTER_ID:-}"" \
  --repo-root=""${KUBE_ROOT}"" \
  --node-instance-group=""${NODE_INSTANCE_GROUP:-}"" \

`

Then copy/paste/execute that output the test runs correctly. But if I just let ginkgo-e2e.sh run the test directly it won't run.

I was able to narrow the issue down by building a small executable that replicates the `minikube` start command. 

What's happening is that the home directory on windows contains forward slashes, which causes problems when the `isoURL` is parsed [in docker/machine](https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/6002b411ce820eaf03ac972a7fb354bb56f7aa95/libmachine/mcnutils/b2d.go#L196.) using `url.Parse`. Given that the error is not handled in `docker/machine`, we actually get a panic when doing `u.Scheme`.

I have added a call to `filepath.ToSlash` to remove forward slashes from the home dir.

I'd like to test this on my windows box, but I've been unable to build for `GOOS=windows`

While the changes here are pretty small, a bigger effort was to create an ISO that contains docker, rkt, and systemd, being ~67MB in size.

The https://buildroot.org/ based config for that image is available here: https://github.com/coreos/minikube-iso. I can include those configs in-tree in this PR too.

We are also investigating a ""CoreOS-slim"" based ISO image which could replace the aforementioned buildroot ISO, but as long as that is not available we could go with this solution first.

What I did for testing locally was to start minikube as follows (after building my PR branch):

```
$ ./out/minikube start \
    --kubernetes-version=file:///home/sur/src/minikube/src/k8s.io/minikube/out/localkube \
    --iso-url=https://github.com/coreos/minikube-iso/releases/download/v0.0.2/minikube-v0.0.2.iso \
    --vm-driver=kvm
```

/cc @dlorenc This PR also introduces more than I envisioned initially ;-) I added a small provisioner for the buildroot based ""minikube"" image, and the ISO image includes docker as well.

TODOs:
- [x] Use rkt with the cni plugin rather than the default no-op
- [x] use rkt v1.14.0 (landing on 9/1) fixing a bug in conjunction with minikube
- [x] Rethink/configure persisting `/var/lib/kubelet`

This prevents minikube from silently falling back to the previously
configured driver instead of the one you've specified.

Right now, `minikube start` will silently fall back to an existing machine on subsequent calls.  For example, if you had previously run a `minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox` then a `minikube start --vm-driver=kvm` would ignore the flag and restart the virtualbox based minikube.

On the flip side, this could be annoying if you run `minikube start --vm-driver=kvm` and then `minikube start` would give you an error text thinking that you meant to use the default (virtualbox).  Of course, this is slightly alleviated now that you can use a config or env var to specify your vm-driver.

nit: I used an os.Exit instead of a glog.Errorf because we run this function in a retry loop and it would print this message 3 times otherwise.

- A config type useful for setting values on arbitrary structs. These values are given by paths as dot-separated strings and string values. The string values are coerced into whatever the type is required at the path before being set. For example:
  `kubelet.foo.bar=bat` will be parsed as ""set KubeletConfig.foo.bar to 'bat'.
- A flag type used to store these config maps in three parts:
1. The component (kubelet, apiserver, dns, etc.)
2. The path (foo.bar).
   3 The value.

Minikube then parses these flags, and passes them along to localkube. This lets you set anything on localkube. To extend this in the future, we'd only need to add support for more types, not each new value. For example, we could add a `net.IP` parser to allow setting struct values as net.IP.

This will allow us to validate settings to catch them before minikube gets incorrectly configured and might help us prevent some problems before they happen.  Right now there are only some basic validations, drivers and CIDR but in the future we could have more complex ones if we have interdependent settings.

There are also callbacks that can give some output to the user.  Right now there is only the ""requires restart"" message so that users know they will have to recreate their VM before their driver changes for instance.

In the future we could use this to set more complex settings like enabling addons or something.  Let me know what you guys think.

order to do this, cluster.StartHost was split into two separate
functions - StartHost and CreateHost instead of having responsibility
for both.  In addition, this also refactors the log messages for start.

TBD 
- What should be the behavior of `minikube delete` wrt to the config?  Right now, it leaves the config as is, but it could also be made to delete the config by default or with a flag.
- Its a little awkward that the settings related to localkube (kubernetes-version, cni, container-runtime) are written directly<sup>[1](https://github.com/r2d4/minikube/blob/edfec2df9af7a670ac4b90cc114e54365f3a2aac/cmd/minikube/cmd/start.go#L134-L136)</sup> because they can be modified without a VM restart.  Suggestions welcome on not doing it like its grossly proposed here.

replaces the dns solution with kube-dns cluster addon.  This will allow
users to swap out DNS implementations by simply turning off the
kube-dns addon.

TBD: **How to handle older localkube versions?**

These versions will try to run their own DNS unless `--enable-dns=false` is passed into localkube.  This will conflict with the addon's clusterIP.  

**Proposed fix in this PR**
I deprecated the flag in newer versions of localkube, and made minikube always pass in `enable-dns=false`.  This will be a no-op in new versions of localkube and disable DNS in favor of the cluster addon in older versions.  We won't need to rebuild any old versions of localkube, but are stuck with a deprecated flag.  

PTAL a look at the first commit which contains the changes.  The second is only removing the unused vendor packages.

The EnvVarUpdate.nsh function is documented as not to be used when updating PATH environment variable (See header in http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Environmental_Variables:_append,_prepend,_and_remove_entries) .

> Default maximum string length is 1024, see Special_Builds for a 8192 max length.

**Fix**
Added a batch script that will do the same thing without any restriction on the environment variable length.

1. The segfault was coming from this line https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/pkg/minikube/cluster/cluster.go#L764

The Err field points to a nil err.  I've change the function to not return an error if no services are found.  This is the only caller of the function so it shouldn't need additional changes.  Returning an error for an empty list would make it hard to inspect whether the call to `get services` failed or there are no services.

This adds a client that implements the libmachine API that calls the drivers directly from the vendored in code.  

- This PR makes it unnecessary to download the `docker-machine-driver-kvm`  binary when running on linux.  
- The NewClient logic is now contained in pkg/minikube/machine, so that there is no way that a client can be created with the wrong parameters (store and certs directories)
- The xhyve driver is currently not vendored in.  Once the a cross compiliation strategy is figured out for the vendored in 9p code in the xhyve driver, we can vendor it in.  



Future TODOs: 

- [ ] Remove all libmachine references in minikube/cmd.  These ideally belong in pkg/minikube, and it will make getting rid of specific libmachine dependencies much easier in the future.
- [ ] Vendor in the xhyve
- [x] Should we add a flag to opt-in to the new implementation?  `--use-vendored-driver=true`  This is easily configurable through this line https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/compare/master...r2d4:vendor-drivers-1?expand=1#diff-8b4e6eb54c05c7ece4be30e54ae7cfaeR53",[],1,2017-01-30 19:38:11,2017-02-07 18:31:40,2017-02-07 18:31:43,True,2017-02-07 18:31:40,r2d4,unknown,,closed

Note that this PR does not contain the critical fix for the hanging problem https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/1107, because the fix is already included in minikube as commit https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/commit/b9a115b3ae5956671c3fa1cdf54f207a28e11073.

wasn't possible to set these values via `--extra-config`.

of a type assertion on its interface.

It's also worth noting that any value with the type `Duration` (e.g.
`proxy.IPTablesSyncPeriod`) is also unable to be set for the same reason,
but this commit does not address that.

	$ make buildroot-image
	$ make out/minikube.iso

- Add en entry in the Makefile for building the container: buildroot-image
- Modify the minikube-iso target to out/minikube.iso to comply with the way
makefiles work.
- Also force the use of a docker container. If not needed
just run IN_DOCKER=1 make out/minikube.iso to avoid the invokation of a docker
container.
- Add some doc.
- The tag added to the generated image will allow to bypass the build of the
image as soon as the container is pushed to the minikube registry.

Should fix (or enable to be fixed) this issue https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/1353

# Why

To improve performance talking directly to pod addresses, raw iptable's ability to jump to NOTRACK and bypass NAT.

If this module is available, this becomes possible. Without this module there is no way to achieve this.

The module will only be loaded when an attempt to access the raw table is made, so it won't affect normal operations.",[],1,2017-04-09 20:26:52,2017-04-09 23:16:45,2017-04-09 23:16:45,True,2017-04-09 23:16:45,r2d4,unknown,,closed

For https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/1353

This is a follow-up to https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/pull/1354

Add `CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_NOTRACK` to the kernel, so that the `xt_CT` module will be available, allowing `-j NOTRACK` as a valid iptables target.

# Why 

In order to be able to use the raw table to speed up traffic, NOTRACK is needed as a target.

This should allow for the following to work:

```
iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -m iprange --dst-range 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.255 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -j NOTRACK```
```

In my testing, this improves non-NAT traffic speed by up to 30% by being able to skip conntrack altogether.

godbus requires the static_build tag when building.  Normal static
compliation doesn't add this go build tag automatically.

Looks like other binaries have manually added this tag also

This should fix https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/1438.

Note: I haven't built an ISO with this yet (intend on doing that soon), but as I described in the issue, I believe the problem is that, despite the numerous calls to partprobe, the disk partition table is *still* not in sync with the kernel.

The approach I have taken is to refactor the existing partition code to try and DRY it up a bit into a few functions. 

The magic sauce here is that I am being a bit heavy-handed and  completely unbinding / rebinding the driver from the block device for the disk. This should have an equivalent effect to rebooting, in terms of re-initializing the device with the kernel. I have used this technique a few times in the past to get me out of sticky situations in production, and it has proven to be an effective technique. I left a couple of calls to sync/partprobe before and after this, but only out of an abundance of caution. 

I'll build an ISO with this and see if I am able to reproduce the issue with the new code, but wanted to get this up for review on the approach.",[],1,2017-05-02 21:08:43,2017-05-04 22:31:38,2017-05-04 23:08:41,True,2017-05-04 22:31:38,aaron-prindle,unknown,,closed

 docker@minikube:~$
```

Due to #1531 I am unable to verify the build myself...

We invoke the shell as follows https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/pkg/minikube/cluster/cluster.go#L537
```go
	return client.Shell(strings.Join(args, "" ""))
```
What happens is that we provide an empty string instead of no value: https://play.golang.org/p/z7DDUWnuYm You can verify this with:

```go
package main

import (
	""strings""
	""fmt""
	
)

func main() {
	args := []string {}
	command := strings.Join(args, "" "")
	fmt.Printf(""Type: %T, Length: %v, Value: %v.\n"", command, len(command), command)
}
```

At https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/libmachine/ssh/client.go#L269 the use of `args ...string` will result in args having a length of 1.

```go
func (client *NativeClient) Shell(args ...string) error {
```

this means that the check at https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/libmachine/ssh/client.go#L318 wrongly assumes that arguments are given, and it will execute https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/libmachine/ssh/client.go#L324

```go
		session.Run(strings.Join(args, "" ""))
```

Docker machine itself uses a different way to invoke the shell https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/e1a03348ad83d8e8adb19d696bc7bcfb18ccd770/commands/ssh.go#L50

```go
	return client.Shell(c.Args().Tail()...)
```

Therefore fixing this with:
```go
	return client.Shell(args...)

Add an optional variable (`$ISO_DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS`) that can be passed via the command line to add additional parameters to `docker build`.

# Description

This change is helpful for people who might be trying to build a Minikube ISO in a local environment and need to use additional parameters to get it to build successfully. My use case for this is mounting a volume from the host with custom SSL certificates, so the build is able to complete (otherwise it fails when it tries to pull `dumb-init` from GitHub).

I tested and verified this to work on RHEL 7.3 and Fedora 26. It also works for me with if I pass arguments or not. Ultimately, I think it's a pretty self-explanatory change, but I'm really new to the Kubernetes / Minikube world, so I'm very open to feedback!

- [ ] Make custom storage provisioner work with the kubeadm bootstrapper.  Currently it doesn't since we run it directly in localkube.  I've skipped that particular integration test right now.
- [ ] Implement the ""extra config"" with the kubeadm config file
- [ ] Use an upstream version of kubeadm once one is released with the `phase alpha controlplane` command.  This was recently merged.
- [ ] Status should check the status of the apiserver.  Currently it just checks the status of the kubelet
- [ ] Logs should return logs of all the components of the control plane.  

TODOs probably in scope for this PR

This delete the default docker configuration in the minikube iso.  This should slightly decrease start time.  I ran into #1811 when caching images.

I've also cherry picked ff2667f, since that seems to fix all the flakiness we've been seeing with the integration tests.

Summaries from the commits:

The docker daemon initially starts up in the ISO, only to be stopped
and replaced by minikube's custom configuration.  This removes the
initial unit, so that docker doesn't automatically start up until
minikube restarts it with its configuration.

Rewrite configureAuth

The current implementation assumes that we already have docker running.
 This switches it to not remove any previous docker configuration
(since there isn't any), and uses our native file transfer utils
instead of the printf commands.


Also, the CopyLocal function can be deleted and the `bootstrapper.ExecRunner.Copy` can be used.  Its included since the CommandRunner isn't merged yet.

This patch would slightly improve the [service-catalog installation process](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/docs/install-1.7.md#rbac) which currently has to instruct users to pass `--extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC` to minikube installations.

* Persistence Test: Don't start up busybox pod in random namespace, since there won't be sufficient RBAC permissions created.  

* Use a randomly generated name for busybox.  If the TestFunctional/DNS ends too closely with TestPersistence, it could try to create a busybox pod, while the one from the DNS test hasn't deleted yet.  Using a randomly generate name prevents this, but we have to query the name after we create it in TestFunctional/DNS so that we can exec into it afterwards.

* Move the kubernetes WaitFor... utils to `pkg/util` and out of the integration tests.  I want to use some of them in #1903 and they might be generally useful outside of the integration tests.  One of these functions also had to change, since the kubernetes library it used was printing things to stdout.

Updated the runc version to its latest master commit.
Got crio into the automounter to get off the tmpfs

This feature bubbles up to the minikube command by reusing the
`--container-runtime=` flag, by enabling the value of ""`crio`"" (`minikube start --container-runtime=crio`), while
the flags/config passed to localkube are more like k8s
(`--container-runtime=remote --remote-runtime-endpoint=/var/run/crio.sock`)

This is mostly ready for review. It is still lacking having
--insecure-registry plumbed through, but for now the policy.json is
open.

Will rebase on crio master once https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o/pull/940 is merged.

minikube,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/minikube/pulls/2136,https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/pull/2136,stefanmb,Fix Update Kubernetes Procedure + Docs,"**Problem**

The contributor guide [instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/contributors/updating_kubernetes.md) for updating k8s do not work out of the box. Step 2 is broken:

> cd minikube
./hack/godeps/godep-restore.sh

This step cannot work because the commits [referenced](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/Godeps/Godeps.json) in `Godeps.json` do not actually exist in upstream repositories. They are generated on the local disk of the maintainer by the [utility script](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/hack/godeps/utils.sh#L49).

If you try to run Minikube's `godep-restore.sh` you will get similar errors:

```
# cd /go/src/k8s.io/api; git pull --ff-only
fatal: No remote repository specified.  Please, specify either a URL or a
remote name from which new revisions should be fetched.
```

```
# cd /go/src/k8s.io/client-go; git checkout fd59f93b7574e389d897810805348182e136776a
fatal: reference is not a tree: fd59f93b7574e389d897810805348182e136776a
```

**Solution**

1. Remove staging dependencies from `Godeps.json` during `godep-restore.sh`
1. Update docs to reference the correct path to Kubernetes' `godep-restore.sh` [script](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/godep-restore.sh).

In this setup, ""minikube dashboard"" fails:
- it invokes firefox on the workstation
- that firefox instance tells the firefox instance on the laptop to open the URL
- the URL can't be accessed because the IP address is local to the workstation

The other two commands where minikube prints or opens URLs are affected the same way. One can of course forward ports manually (ssh, socat, etc.), but I found it more convenient to let minikube do that automatically, so here's a PR which adds --proxy and --proxyaddress parameters to all three commands. Documentation is in doc/networking.md.

I've contributed to other open source projects before, but not yet to k8s and not in Go, so please beware that there might be novice mistakes - sorry for that in advance!

to run nested virtualization if the host is configured accordingly i.e.
`kvm_intel nested=y` in `/etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf`.

To turn on nesting, a user has to specify `--kvm-cpu-model host-model` when
creating the VM.

**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):

Enable explicitly the `kube-dns` addon via:

```
❯ sudo minikube addons enable kube-dns
```

Start a Minikube bootstrap with RBAC enabled via:

```shell
❯ sudo minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC
``` 

Explicitly have `kubectl` use the newly started minikube k8s cluster's context.
Commonly created as a `minikube` context. (*may differ for you*):

```
❯ sudo kubectl config use-context minikube
```

Observe the logs of the started `kube-dns` pod container `kubedns` (*pod may die due to health check and you must wait for a new one to start*) :

```
❯ kubectl logs -n kube-system -f `kubectl get -n kube-system pod --selector k8s-app=kube-dns -o json | jq -r '.items[0].metadata.name'` -c kubedns
```


**Output of `minikube logs` (if applicable)**: Not applicable.

The node within the VM currently has the same name as the VM, which is set to the profile name. This causes a problem when the profile name is not `minikube` since the kubelets are hard-coded to look for a host called `minikube` [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/pkg/minikube/bootstrapper/kubeadm/versions.go#L184) which causes the cluster to fail to start.

This pull request changes the NodeName within the VM to use a constant `minikube` instead of the MachineName (`GetMachineName` returns the profile name if set, or `minikube` otherwise).

I also noted that it is possible to set a profile with spaces `minikube profile ""test profile""`) and I didn't test what problems that might cause, but I think it would cause problems if the NodeName had spaces, which is one reason why I chose to change the NodeName to a constant `minikube` instead of changing the kubelets to look for the proper name. Also it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to set the name of the node within the VM to the profile name.",[],0,2018-04-13 08:10:38,2018-05-08 09:01:20,2018-05-08 09:01:27,False,,,unknown,,closed

Description of problem with kvm driver as it's written:

It searches the dnsmasq status file for hostname=machinename. This means it works for the default case where --profile=minikube, and there aren't yet any dhcp leases, it will work.

https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/f5d945597d46b17bd6a6683206801e540113de9b/pkg/drivers/kvm/network.go#L136-L138

The problem is that in libvert dnsmasq this name is always equal to /etc/hostname from the minikube machine, which is always minikube. 
```
> cat /var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/virbr0.status
[
    {
        ""ip-address"": ""192.168.122.230"",

    },
]
```

Machine names I have running:
```

 14    machine2                       running
```

As you can see the names of the machines do not correspond to hosts in the virbr0.status file. Simply switching to check for MAC address seems to resolve this issue for me with master.

Fix for #2717 

## Summary:

The kubelets are hard-coded to look for a node called `minikube`. However, currently the `NodeName` is set to be the `MachineName` which is set to the profile name. This means that when the profile is not `minikube`, the cluster fails to start.

This pull requests solves the issue by fixing the `NodeName` of the kubeadm node to `minikube` regardless of the profile.

An alternative solution is to remove the `hostname-override` completely so that the kubelets *should* also look for a node with the same name as the profile name. However, in this case, profile names with spaces cause the cluster to fail. A first pass at fixing the issue can be seen here: https://github.com/petertrotman/minikube/tree/hostname-override but more work needs to be done.

## Next Steps:

Currently, `profile` functionality is completely broken due to this issue. I believe that simply setting the `NodeName` to `minikube` is a complete and fuss-free solution - I don't see any particular reason why the user cares about the cluster's internal `NodeName`. However, I am happy to do a bit of work to make removing `hostname-override` viable, if that is what the maintainers want. So I would like a decision of either 'yes this pull request will do' or 'no we need to do this by removing `hostname-override` so make that happen instead'.",[],3,2018-05-08 09:09:23,2018-06-18 15:39:12,2018-06-18 16:02:53,True,2018-06-18 15:39:12,dlorenc,unknown,,closed

I think we can get a much more stable minikube on Linux using lxd, without spending very much effort doing so.
I've added a driver to use minikube with lxd. This is still a WIP, but I want to get feedback and help at this point which is why I'm opening the PR now already.
The lxd driver is actually super simple (so far) because lxd has a rest api that uses a unix socket and has a go client implementing the api.
What I've implemented so far:
- lifecycle: create, start, stop, delete etc.
- ssh: relies on $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_lxd key existing
Currently the driver expects an lxd image aliased `base-minikube` to exist that has docker installed and ssh configured with $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_lxd.pub (setup using the default lxd profile).
For networking, the driver is hardcoded to return the first eth0 inet address.

I used an image based off of ubuntu:16.04 and installed docker-ce
starting minikube with this config gets to the step of `Starting cluster components...` and bombs out with error 
```
Error starting cluster:  kubeadm init error sudo /usr/bin/kubeadm init --config /var/lib/kubeadm.yaml ... 
...
Process exited with status 2
```
The first time I got ssh to work it actually got further than this, it got to the point where it was trying to connect to the apiserver, but I couldn't see any docker containers running `docker ps` in the lxd container.

So what we really need at this point is a prebaked image that works with current minikube infrastructure.
Ideally we use an image based off of the minikube image in this repo that is built using buildroot. I have no experience with that however and it doesn't seem very noob friendly. I tried just building the image locally and after a couple of hours the build failed because it ran out of disk space. So I assume buildroot compiles the entire system from scratch? I'd ideally not have to build an entire system from scratch. If anyone with buildroot experience or lxd image building experience or both can help me over this obstacle that would be awesome.

There also are some refactorings that I've been doing in the process of understanding the code, they are not strictly necessary but I believe they make the code clearer a bit.

Besides refactorings, there are two major changes:
- ExecRunner is changed to use sudo internally, thus it is not required to run `minikube` as root anymore;
- `--vm-driver=none` now uses 127.0.0.1 instead of the host's external IP.

I'm not entirely positive on the last change, but binding to the host's external IP is unforgivable (because it is bound to change, and I hated to restart the cluster whenever I changed networks on my workstation laptop). I suspected that the host's external IP is used here because it gets propagated inside some containers (which obviously won't work with a loopback address), but I've perused the code lightly and couldn't find any places where this would matter.

Anyway, 127.0.0.1 seems to work, and I tried to ask on #minikube in Slack to confirm this but got no response. If someone explains how exactly it is wrong to use 127.0.0.1, I'll change this to add a throwaway private IP to the host's loopback interface and use it.",['luxas'],14,2018-08-12 23:58:38,2019-03-21 02:31:34,2019-03-21 02:31:34,False,,,dirty,False,closed

- fixed the documentation link
- hardens the deletion of the network: checks if it really is not used by any other VM, and only deletes it if this instance of the minikube VM is the last one using it

It's been a while that I've written these fixes, and because of the big delay on our company's side with signing the CNCF CLA, this PR comes rather late. I'm happy it's sorted out though, and I can create the PR. Looking over the code again though, it looks like everything is in place.

the use of JSON as a configuration store and wanting it to map to certain
configuration structures. This unfortunately led to issues where it was
implicitly required that all Kubernetes versions be specified with a
leading 'v' prefix or various operations would fail.

This patch:
- Replaces as many instances of string-based versions with semver.Version
  objects as possible.
- Makes version parsing more reliable by consistently using
  strings.TrimPrefix to remove the 'v' prefix when needed.
- Kubernetes versions stored in profiles are normalised to not having the
  'v' prefix. Existing profile configurations with a 'v' prefix will still
  work.
- Validates versions being passed in to make sure they'll parse.

The [default settings for the VirtualBox machine](https://github.com/docker/machine/blob/master/drivers/virtualbox/virtualbox.go#L76) enables `DNSProxy` and disables `HostDNSResolver`.  I'd like to propose reversing these settings.  If the host is used for DNS resolution, we can enable the kubernetes cluster to resolve registry URLs like `registry.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:80`, assuming that the host has properly configured a `cluster.local` resolver that routes traffic to the minikube network.

This should not cause any backwards-incompatible issues (so far as I can tell) and should be a drop-in replacement for what folks are already using.

To reproduce the error:

1) Use a GPU such as Titan X Pascal.
2) Start minikube with `minikube start --vm-driver kvm2  --gpu`
3) Install the NVIDIA driver: `minikube addons enable nvidia-driver-installer`

The driver installation will then fail. Further investigation shows that this is because the command `nvidia-smi` fails with the error `Unable to determine the device handle for GPU 0000:0X:00.0: Unknown Error`.

The error occurs because NVIDIA doesn't seem to support GPU passthrough for certain lower-end models such as the Titan X family.

The fix for this is to hide the KVM hypervisor signature (see [here](https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-August/msg00744.html)). I have tested this fix with Titan X Pascal and the NVIDIA driver was installed successfully and the GPU works well without any problem in Minikube.

This PR adds the ability to resolve service FQDNs from host during `minikube tunnel`. 

Currently this is only implemented for macOS, (via its resolver which allows easily overriding nameservers for a particular domain). Some potential implementations for other platforms are:

**Linux**
- An appropriately configured systemd network unit, which would operate similarly to macOS's resolver (though would require the host be using systemd-resolved's stub resolver)
- mDNS ""proxy"" which responds to host requests for `*.svc.<clusterDomain>` by querying the cluster's DNS service

**Windows**
- mDNS ""proxy"", as above
- ???

Unfortunately, an error has occurred:

This error is likely caused by:
        - The kubelet is not running
        - The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
        - 'systemctl status kubelet'
        - 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI, e.g. docker.
Here is one example how you may list all Kubernetes containers running in docker:
        - 'docker ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
        Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
        - 'docker logs CONTAINERID'

These messages are plumbed through to the message.Printer API, which provides a mechanism for future localization. Full support for styles is currently only enabled for TERM's which mention ""color"", and only then if it's writing to a TTY.

It is possible to manually turn styles off and on by setting MINIKUBE_IN_COLOR=[01] in your environment.

- Localized output to 5+ written languages
- Pre-flight error checks for common connectivity and configuration errors

- Remove kubectl download guidance when minikube is run without `kubectl` in path, as is often the case when run as root. The installation guidance provided conflicted with the offficial instructions anyways.
- The giant none warning was no longer accurate. Linked to doc for more information. 
- Make chown command work when there is no group named $USER
- The dashboard will now exit much earlier if kubectl is missing.
- Log an error if the bootstrapper can't be initialized
- Some mentions of VM should actually be cluster, particularly when used with none.

⚠️  The 'none' driver provides limited isolation and may reduce system security and reliability.
⚠️  For more information, see:
👉  https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/vmdriver-none.md

⚠️  kubectl and minikube configuration will be stored in /root
⚠️  To use kubectl or minikube commands as your own user, you may
⚠️  need to relocate them. For example, to overwrite your own settings:

    ▪ sudo mv /root/.kube /root/.minikube $HOME
    ▪ sudo chown -R $USER $HOME/.kube $HOME/.minikube

💡  This can also be done automatically by setting the env var CHANGE_MINIKUBE_NONE_USER=true

* Guest service is not enabled by default. Once it's checked in Hyper-V setting, the Fcopy daemon will be brought up by systemd, in which case you may leverage FCopy cmdlet to copy file into the VM",[],6,2019-04-01 03:03:06,,2019-04-02 19:48:03,False,,,unstable,True,open

On a new box in AWS, minikube was not working unless I used `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` as the `resolv.conf` (which was by the way solved in kubernetes itself here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63691/files )

But VirtualBox, the same scripts that were provisioning the box in aws were failing if I used k8s v0.11.x, v0.12.x or v0.13.x. (Things did work on k8s v0.14.0)

`grep -E ""^nameserver"" /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf  |head -n 3 > /tmp/resolv.conf && sudo -E minikube --vm-driver=none start --extra-config=kubelet.resolv-conf=/tmp/resolv.conf`

Did solve the problem, but of course it took me 3 days to find out. Therefore I want to share the knowledge and save other people's time.

At first I though this would be to specific to my setup, but my test was done with a new VirtualBox machine provisioning from the official ubuntu 18.04.02 iso, all that done with scripts, so I can replicate the problem and the solution and my local environment should have nothing to do with it. If more users could test this before it get's merged, maybe that's  good idea.

That is great, except that it does not make sense when `--vmdriver=none`.
When cache is enabled, 
 - `minikube` download the images to `~/.minikube/cache`
 - `minikube` loads them (`docker load -i ~/.minikube/cache/someimage`)

When `--vmdriver=none`, the machine's docker is used, so any loaded image will be stored there ""forever"" anyway. Hence they are already cached. And setting the cache enable has actually two downsides:

- it uses local disk space unnecessarily
- on every `minikube` launch it will load images from `~/.minikube/cache/someimage` to docker, even though they are there already.

So these 5 lines of code do speedup the launch!",[],2,2019-04-05 02:11:20,,2019-04-05 11:37:22,False,,,unstable,True,open
