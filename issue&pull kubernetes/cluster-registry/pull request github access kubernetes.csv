This is now ready to test.

Currently hitting re-defined flags being added due to standalone and delegated sharing similar flags e.g. `authentication-token-webhook-cache-ttl`, `client-ca-file`, etc. Need to either create a common interface for both with a common option flag structure they can both share, create different subcommands, or something else. Problem with a common interface and common option flag structure is that for delegated we rely on the `apiserver` API which we don't own, whereas for standalone we have our own implementation. Also see #69 for more details.

Fix for #8 when this PR is complete.

- Separates out aggregated and standalone init and delete sub-commands into their own files.
- Adds delete sub-command to aggregated and standalone deployments.
- Adds a `--force` option for the delete sub-command.

This provides a fix for #48 by allowing the proper deletion of the cluster registry before proceeding with initializing it again.

Providing an equivalent `--force` flag for the `init` sub-command requires checking for an `AlreadyExists` object error status and if it exists, retrieve it to continue using that object. This retrieved object can potentially have been initialized with different options from the current run. That is, the already stored object may contain parameters that may preclude the option flags requested by the user during the latest run. This makes the solution not as clean IMO. So I'd like to propose moving forward with this solution for now.

After discussions with various people, I think that having the internal version doesn't provide enough benefit to be worth the maintenance cost. The one benefit that I know of for keeping the internal version is that it provides a standardized format for external versions to be converted into, but it seems like this purpose can be equally well served by an external type which other external types are converted into.

Until I changed from `cluster` to `clusters`, it didn't work.

Before:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  labels:
    app: clusterregistry
  name: clusterregistry.k8s.io:apiserver
rules:

  - clusterregistry.k8s.io
  resources:
  - cluster
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - create
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
```

After (only change is `clusters` under `resources`):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  labels:
    app: clusterregistry
  name: clusterregistry.k8s.io:apiserver
rules:
- apiGroups:

  resources:
  - clusters
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - create
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
```

This brings up another question. What is the purpose of this `ClusterRole`? It's bound to the `ServiceAccount` in the `ClusterRoleBinding` of the same name but I'm not familiar with when that would be used. Any instruction here would be appreciated.

Remove unnecessary cluster role and cluster role binding objects as I don't think we'll need it. This is mainly used to provide permissions for controllers within the cluster to perform specific cluster operations e.g. an admission controller to perform specific cluster resource operations. This cleans up and simplifies the code a bit. We can always add it back later if needed.

The [k8s docs on this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/setup-extension-api-server/) are a little misleading and suggest this is needed.

Please do not remove. -->

/sig multicluster

This PR proposes two changes to the cluster registry API:

- adding a conditions object to the status, and defining one condition, `OK`
- removing the list of providers with maps of data from `AuthInfo` in favor of two object references, one for controller authentication and one for user authentication.

I think the first change is valuable before we move the API to beta, and the condition I've defined is relevant to any environment that's running a cluster registry. The second change doesn't change the expressiveness of the API in any way, but it provides a more clear split between how controllers and users interact with the cluster object, and an easier-to-work with interface for allowing users to use the cluster registry to get access to credentials. It also works around a minor issue with CRD validation spec generation.

With these changes I would feel comfortable moving the API to beta.
