----

The fake implementation of pkg/util/exec for test programs is kind of really annoying to use. This PR adds some wrapper functions to make it easier, AND to automatically check that the passed-in command was what you expected (which some tests were doing but most weren't).

So:

    fcmd := fakeexec.FakeCmd{
            CombinedOutputScript: []fakeexec.FakeCombinedOutputAction{
                    // iptables version check
                    func() ([]byte, error) { return []byte(""iptables v1.9.22""), nil },
                    // iptables-restore version check
                    func() ([]byte, error) { return []byte(""iptables-restore v1.9.22""), nil },
                    // Success.
                    func() ([]byte, error) { return []byte{}, nil },
            },
    }
    fexec := fakeexec.FakeExec{
            CommandScript: []fakeexec.FakeCommandAction{
                    func(cmd string, args ...string) exec.Cmd { return fakeexec.InitFakeCmd(&fcmd, cmd, args...) },
                    func(cmd string, args ...string) exec.Cmd { return fakeexec.InitFakeCmd(&fcmd, cmd, args...) },
                    func(cmd string, args ...string) exec.Cmd { return fakeexec.InitFakeCmd(&fcmd, cmd, args...) },
            },
    }

becomes

    fexec := fakeexec.NewFakeExec(t, nil)
    fexec.AddCommand(""iptables"", ""--version"").
    	SetCombinedOutput(""iptables v1.9.22"", nil)
    fexec.AddCommand(""iptables-restore"", ""--version"").
    	SetCombinedOutput(""iptables-restore v1.9.22"", nil)
    fexec.AddCommand(""iptables"", ""-w2"", ""-N"", ""FOOBAR"", ""-t"", ""nat"").
    	SetCombinedOutput("""", nil)

There's some discussion on the original kubernetes bug (which I'm going to rebase on top of this to cover only the ""porting pkg/util to the new interface"" part). The June 27 comment about it not passing ""make verify"" no longer seems to be a problem with the migration of fakeexec into a separate subdirectory.","['apelisse', 'mengqiy', 'monopole']",1,2017-08-09 16:12:31,2018-03-22 06:12:54,2018-03-22 06:12:54,False,,,unknown,,closed

This is because of how pointers and copies are handled in the FakeClock structure.

Here, we determine whether to still retain a timer by comparing the registered waiters and the current timer/waiter, and if they do not match, we retain the timer (as it is not the timer being cancelled): https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/blob/master/clock/testing/fake_clock.go#L225-L240

However, we instantiate the `fakeClockWaiter` as a non-pointer within the Timer structure, and record this structure in a slice stored on the FakeClock. You can see that happening here: https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/blob/master/clock/testing/fake_clock.go#L89-L94

The issue is that on L94, we actually create a copy of the `fakeClockWaiter`, which means that the comparison on L232 will never match, and so *all* timers will be retained.

This PR changes the slice in the FakeClock to be a slice of *pointers*, which resolves the issue.

This allows e.g. to wrap those readers with a `io.limitedReader` and other standard (and non-standard) mechanisms for generic `io.Reader`s. This is currently not possible, as access to Std{out,err} is only possible via:
- handing in a `io.Writer`s
- inspecting the returned `[]byte`s from the `Output`/`CombinedOutput` methods

Specifically, we were looking into https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70890 where we would jut employ an `io.limitedReader` to stop reading input after a certain amount of data.

https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/pull/68 and then brought back
glog, which now breaks vendoring of k8s.io/utils (can't have both glog
and klog defining the same command line flags).

Instead of replacing the logging with klog, logging gets removed
entirely. The rationale is that the log output is likely to be more
useful and/or readable if it is done by the caller. This is also a
first step towards removing the klog dependency from
k8s.io/utils (https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/pull/68#issuecomment-457249328).
