The user is expected to define the following variables in group_vars/all.yml:

```
networking: opencontrail

opencontrail_public_subnet: <External subnet for LoadBalancer services>
opencontrail_private_subnet: <Internal subnet with connectivity to the kubelets>
opencontrail_gateway: <optional | gateway address on private_subnet>
opencontrail_interface: eth1
```

The provisioning assumes that the system has two interfaces: a management interface (e.g. on board 1G interface) and 1 data interface (e.g. 2x10G bond0 interface).

To configure the software gateway that provides connectivity between the external network and the private virtual networks a new type of host ""gateway"" is defined. Example inventory file:

```
[masters]
roque-kube-master

[etcd]
roque-kube-master

[nodes]
roque-node3 ipaddr=192.168.1.3/24
roque-node4 ipaddr=192.168.1.4/24

[gateways]
roque-gateway ipaddr=192.168.1.254/24
```
## Details
- OpenContrail uses kubelet to execute its userspace components. This implies running kubelet on the master, similarly to the approach taken by salt provisioning scripts which use kubelet to run the kubernetes api-server, etc.
- The OpenContrail kernel module is compiled on-demand for the target.
- OpenContrail control plane components are distributed as containers (via docker hub).

```
    log := math.Log10($NUM_LINES_CHANGED)

So lets assume that $NUM_LINES_CHANGED == 3.

    logPlus    == 0.9771212547196624

This means that further on weightSum (and other things) will be calculated by
a multiple by fileWeight and thus will get the value of 0. Both

`100.0*float64(potentialOwners[cur])/float64(weightSum)`
  and
`selection := rand.Int63n(weightSum)`

Will cause a panic if weightSum == 0

I solve this by adding 1 to the fileWeight after it is truncated to
int64. So we can never get a value of 0.

When the ansible script for etcd runs, it sets `ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS` to `http://kube-master:2379`, which, when kube-master is on the localhost line of `/etc/hosts`, acts like it's setting `ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS` to localhost, and so the nodes can't talk to etcd.

The PR takes the `vagrant-ansible.yml` file that adds an entry for each of the vagrant VMs in the `/etc/hosts` of each VM, and extends it to remove the hostname from the localhost line.

It may be that I'm not seeing the importance of this vagrant behavior, but ansible/vagrant with the Vagrantfile as written doesn't work without making this change.

This PR would change that, pulling the packages from the extras repo.

The docker and kubernetes packages from the extras repo are updated about every six weeks, following updates to RHEL Atomic Host, so they're reasonably up-to-date. The CBS packages tend to be fairly bleeding-edge, with changes that might not match user expectations of CentOS. For instance, the current kubenetes-client package provided by the CBS repo includes a `kubectl` that's symlinked to the `openshift` executable.

There may be a reason why the packages from extras weren't acceptable in the past -- this repo didn't include kube 1.0 until August, for instance, but I think extras is the right source for our packages at this point. 

@eparis, does this sound reasonable to you?

public floating IP attached to the master.  This caused `make-ca-cert.sh`
to fail in a very obscure way while doing a `cp` of a nonexistent
cert, with `stderr` redirected to `/dev/null`.

Now apparently there's a reason for directing `easyrsa` `stderr`
to `/dev/null` - OpenSSL is just verbose.

But for the other things, e.g. curl has a `-s` flag.  And AFAICS
there was never any reason to hide errors from `cp`.

Explicitly using the `v` flag to tar but also redirecting to
`/dev/null` was clearly a left hand not knowing what the right hand is
doing sort of thing.  Just drop both.

Anyways, we fix the real problem here by cleanly erroring out if we
fail to get the public IP from any of the cluod providers, before we
even try to make a cert.

If you are in the To: line of this email, you have flaky tests to fix! Flaky
tests, even if they flake only a small percentage of the time, cause the merge
queue to become very long, which causes everyone on the team pain and
suffering.  Please either fix the tests assigned to you or find them an owner
who will fix them.

There were 11 P2/P3 issues which are not reported here.

The systemd unit files could have been updated directly to fix this, but as flanneld is installed from a distro package, a less invasive approach was taken instead: A dummy systemd target unit is introduced, which starts after network-online.target, but before the fragile services.

- Create a secret with one of your favorite tool
- Update your loadbalancer POD to something like the following

``` yaml
        ports:
        # All http services
        - containerPort: 80
          hostPort: 80

``` yaml
      args:
      - --ssl-cert=/ssl/crt.pem
      - --ssl-ca-cert=/ssl/ca.crt
      - --namespace=default

I put godeps in this directory, assuming that @mikedanese refactor will go through. 

Originally I had this in few commits, but after fun with godeps I have only one now. If requested I'll split it for easier review. (I'll certainly split off godeps as a first commit).

I'm sending it now to figure out who can is willing to review this tool. Normally it'd be @wojtek-t, but he's out until Feb and I'd rather have it merged sooner - it's not strictly necessary, as it's a standalone tool, so I won't need to do any rebases and it'll be available as soon as some reasonable PR is created.

I think that @mwielgus is the second best candidate, but I'm not sure he'll have time.

It also supports defining routes and routing rules using additional annotations.
The next release of keepalived is going to add support for routing rules.

New annotations are:
- k8s.io/public-vip-netmask 
- k8s.io/public-vip-route

This looks like this:

```
k8s.io/public-vip: ""11.22.33.44""
k8s.io/public-vip-netmask: ""24""
k8s.io/public-vip-route: ""11.22.33.254""
```

Add flags for:
- path to keepalived binary
- path to template filename
- path to keepalived.conf
- path to keepalived.pid
- template generation debug (does not start keepalived)
- to enable ipvs conntrack (implemented it before it was upstream and added to flag to keep upstream behavior by default)

serves 2 very distinct web pages (submit-queue and cherrypick-queue)

Both queues need to look at very different sets of PRs. submit-queue
cares about open PRs. Cherrypick needs to look at open and closed PRs.
While at first glance it might seem easy to just make the submit-queue
ignore closed PRs (it is easy) it would mean that the submit queue would
have to walk all 22000+ issues on every loop, obviously ignoring most of
them.

Instead for the cherry-pick we are able to limit the issues we walk to a
given label (cherrypick-candidate), so even though we are walking all
issues (open or close) that number becomes quite managable. Obviously we
can't just walk the issues with that label for the submit queue...

Thus we end up with 1 binary which is becoming two distinct 'apps' with
distinct configuration. The makefile defaults to deploying and working
with the 'submit-queue' APP, but one can use APP=cherrypick

This is intended for a simple staging setup, with two EC2 instances: One for the master and one for the worker.

The way you use it is like this:
1. Create a file 'aws-variables.sh', containing the following variables
    \* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
    \* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your secret AWS access key
    \* `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region you wish to deploy to
    \* `AWS_MASTER_IP`: The private IP you wish to assign to your master EC2 instance
    \* `AWS_WORKER_IP`: The private IP you wish to assign to your worker EC2 instance
    \* `AWS_KEY_NAME`: The name of the SSH key pair (registered in AWS) you wish to use
2. Execute `apply-terraform.sh`

`apply-terraform.sh` will invoke terraform on the 'staging.tf' file, which I suggest you read in order to figure out what is taking place while setting up the AWS infrastructure.

I am basically creating this PR in order to seek help from others in finishing this setup, as it's not yet working and I'm finding it difficult to figure out what to do.

Based on kubernetes/kubernetes#22912.

This PR refactored Perfdash to use the new [performance data type](https://github.com/Random-Liu/kubernetes/blob/kubelet-perf/test/e2e/perftype/perftype.go#L45) added in kubernetes/kubernetes#22912.

With this PR, it is easy to add more e2e performance test support. You just need to:
1) Transform e2e performance test result into [`PerfData`](https://github.com/Random-Liu/kubernetes/blob/kubelet-perf/test/e2e/perftype/perftype.go#L45) in _k8s/kubernetes/test/e2e/perftype_, and print the `PerfData` in e2e test log.
2) Add corresponding jenkins project into `JenkinsProjects` in `config.go`.
3) Add test description and test name into `DescriptionName` in `config.go`.
Then, Perfdash will automatically and periodically fetch data from specified jenkins projects, parse the test log and generate graph.

I've tested the PR locally with a fake `downloader`. However it would be better to merge kubernetes/kubernetes#22912 first, and test this PR with real jenkins project.

It's a small hack that I need, as @justinsb PRs are stalled. It's small though, so it should be pretty straightforward to review - @eparis can you review the changes from the second commit only? It'd be great if you could do this sooner rather than later.

- By default on VirtualBox public interface is not `eth0`, but `eth1`: I automatically use proper interface for flannel and when generating `/etc/hosts`.
  
  This should fix #586 .
- Fix `bin_dir` on CentOS with K8S installed from packages.

These changes are _almost_ enough to start K8S cluster in Vagrant on VirtualBox + CentOS 7.
Unfortunately CentOS 7 yet have only [1.2.0alpha1](https://git.centos.org/summary/rpms!kubernetes.git) which doesn't include [commit with `successThreshold` and `failureThreshold` liveness probe parameter](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/1e88a682da871a4a7f811dc5efcfe3890be8bbf8). This leads to errors in `kube-addons` like following one:

```

```

To bypass this issue I locally patched kube-addons scripts to include `--validate=false` in `kubectl` invocations:

```

I haven't tested that configured cluster is actually working (see failing kibana-logging above), but at least it looks like properly configured.

My goal is to setup cluster on CoreOS in Vagrant and these changes are required for this anyway (e.g. proper network interface configuration).

contrib,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/contrib/pulls/620,https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/620,feliksik,deploy to ubuntu 15.10 [WIP,"I have recently been working to deploy to Ubuntu 15.10 (preparing for systemd in the 16.04 LTS release). I would like to contribute, but am new to the k8s community. I like to have some alignment that assures me we will push the same direction. This PR is intended to gather some insight on how to make the ansible module more portable, as I think that is nontrivial. 

I see multiple people are using the contrib/ansible repo ( #428 #619 #586 #508 #406, a simple search: https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ansible&type=Issues ). Some nice people like @eparis @rsmitty @danehans @rutsky have been working on improving it. 

I see that we attempt to make a number of things flexible: 
- k8s version, and binary/source distribution (i see the source_type variable is used). 
- OS distribution (the `when: ansible_distribution != ""CoreOS""` is used in roles/tasks/flannel/client). I am afraid this when: thingy is tricky to use for all kinds of different OS's. 
- the ip addresses of the peers, and the way in which to define this (`ansible_hostname` or `ansible_fqdn`, but what about if we want to use an internal network?)
- the users that are assumed to be present on the system (e.g. 'etcd' was a user not present on ubuntu; maybe no assumptions should be made at all)
- the location where `etcdctl` turns out to be installed (`usr/bin/etcdctl` didn't hold after installing on ubuntu)

Some choice to make things more portable: 
- standardize on certain choices (e.g. no matter the OS, the implementation of the etcdctl installer _must_ create a binary in /usr/bin ; but I think a better standard would be: no matter the OS, the binaries must end up in $PATH and we don't use a full path in calling the binary);
- be configurable (e.g. the IP address of the peers). You can configure in group_vars/all, but you can also split this into separate groups. Currently i see ansible_fqdn and ansible_hostnames used, but this is pretty big assumption (imagine eth1 is your internal net you which to use -- not external eth0)
- be modular (e.g. the tool that configures the network for ubuntu). 

Tools that create flexibility: 
- use of `group_vars`
- use of `host_vars`
- indirect variables (you can set `i_am_kubelet_with_name: {{ansible_hostname}}` in group_vars/nodes and it will be defined for all hosts in `nodes` group, but have a different value)
- modularity 1: dynamic filename of  `include: install_flannel_on_{{ansible_distribution}}.yml`
- modularity 2: running things conditionally with `when: ansible_distribution == ""CoreOS""`

I happen to have quite some experience with Ansible and have made significant effort with group_vars, host_vars, and levels of indirection to make things highly configurable. Ansible is super-liberal in how to approach such issues, making things very much a matter of taste.
It is certainly possible do do it more robust/portable, but I also figured it is not trivial (especially since you don't easily test on all environments). I think it requires a well chosen set of best practices. Is there a philosophy on how to these portability issues? How feels/is in the lead?

Core OS on other providers (OpenStask and libvirt) are not supported. It's easy to add them --- just specify proper Vagrant image --- but I don't have proper environment to test.

As you can see in the output above cluster is not properly setup --- there is at least one error with Flannel configuration in VirtualBox: wrong interface selected because Flannel settings are not properly passed to flannel.
@danehans in 7604d83e337e85af5c2ff32681067d5c7e75f127 you introduced `FLANNELD_OPTIONS` for Core OS that should mimic `FLANNEL_OPTIONS` for other configurations. However `FLANNEL_OPTIONS` value are passed to `flanneld` process as command line argument, and `FLANNELD_OPTIONS` is exposed to the Flannel as the environment variable which doesn't work for me and shouldn't according to Flannel documentation (each option from `FLANNEL_OPTIONS` like `--iface=eth1` should be converted to something like `FLANNEL_IFACE=eth1`).

I hope to fix this (and maybe other issues) next week in separate pull request.

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/flanneld -etcd-endpoints=${FLANNEL_ETCD} -etcd-prefix=${FLANNEL_ETCD_KEY} $FLANNEL_OPTIONS
```

Which allows to use variables like `FLANNEL_ETCD` in
`/etc/sysconfig/flanneld`.

Currently used approach on CoreOS uses flannel-specific environment
variables `FLANNELD_*`. However there is no way to pass arbitrary options
to flanneld daemon using `FLANNELD_*` environment variables (and currently
used `FLANNELD_OPTIONS` doesn't work actually).

Lets start flanneld in the same way on CoreOS to unify using of
environment files.

This fixes settings public ethernet interface in Ansible+Vagrant+VirtualBox+CoreOS configuration, noted in #644.

The daemon stays till the volume is unmounted. If systemd stops kubelet with killMode=control-group (the default), both kubelet and glusterfs daemon is killed, while the container stays alive with a broken bind mount. When systemd starts kubelet again, even though kubelet is able to re-mount the volume, the broken bind mount in the container cannot be repaired. This is what happened in Kubernetes #13511

The proposed fix is to tell systemd to just kill kubelet and leave other processes alive by setting killMode=process, the glusterfs daemon stays with the container when kubelet is stopped.

This controller would be launched as a pod (single-instance), and is configured with a service to expose (likely the nginx service).  It watches for that service, observes the ingress name/IP.  It also watches all ingress objects.  Whenever an ingress object is created with a hostname rule, we try to configure that in Route53, pointing the name to the configured service.

It (mostly?) works, but I have done no optimization yet (e.g. to reduce the number of API calls).  Also I would naturally add a backend for GCE DNS (and I'm sure there will be a desire for other services also, hence it is pluggable)

Comments appreciated (though I think mostly on the concept rather than the details of the implementation at this stage)

@iterion - similar to work you've done for services

cc @bprashanth because you seem to be the ingress guru - can you give me any pointers about whether this is useful, who I should talk to etc.

This patch does not change the current list of ports opened publicly. 
It just provides to CI operator a choice to decide to open the port when running e2e tests for:

*\* `[k8s.io] Proxy version v1 [It] should proxy to cadvisor`
*\* `[k8s.io] Proxy version v1 [It] should proxy to cadvisor using proxy subresource`

Not sure if keeping the port closed to public by default is intended. Maybe it should be opened by default and the `open_cadvisor_port` variable removed.

Hit an ansible bug: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/13818 that effects ansible > 2.0, so I rolled back to 1.9.4, and this works. The bug makes ansible unable to find the templates/files in the role when run from Vagrant.

Would appreciate feedback @danehans @rutsky @adamschaub 

Refactor of etcd role to be modeled after [openstack-ansible](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/tree/kilo) and [hpe-helion](https://github.com/hpe-helion-os/helion-ansible). Confirmed on Virtualbox + CoreOS and Virtualbox + Centos
- I think we should always use the binaries from github, regardless of OS, so we can always control the version of etcd present. CoreOS comes with etcd, we would have to uninstall and install the specified version for CoreOS. Where Centos uses the [generic package installer](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/package_module.html) as seen [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/ansible/roles/etcd/tasks/main.yml#L2). It does not support versions, we currently just specify `latest` and end up with the latest copy of etcd that is in yum/apt-get. (A very unlucky person could be running the install script and the version served by yum/apt-get might get changed during their deployment, leaving them with different versions of etcd) Ubuntu is the only one using the binaries right now, seen [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/ansible/roles/etcd/tasks/main.yml#L11). Using binaries will let anyone regardless of OS to use a specific version of etcd.

Design Question:
- Not sure where `deploy.yml` should live. I put it one level up from `tasks` right now since its wraps a bunch of `etcd/tasks` playbooks together
- How granular do we want bottom level playbooks that live in the task file.
  - `install.yml` has all install instructions regardless of OS.
  - `install.yml` just cycles through each OS supported, and calls plays like `install-coreos.yml` `install-ubuntu.yml`
    - Right now I'm breaking it out if there is more than 2 statements that apply to the same `when`, see `coreos-start.yml` and `coreos-stop.yml`. I see this is being a bit more manageable down the road at the cost of the directory getting a little crowded.

This is made worse if you have a large cluster as it will be receiving the health check to each node for each service every second, it wouldn't be unrealistic for you to end up with 100rps from just health checks in a large cluster.

I believe there are discussions to have more granular ways to configure healthcheck and other params, but for now this added a flag to allow the interval to be increased.

Much like the `--health-check-path` this is simply `--health-check-internval`

contrib,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/contrib/pulls/937,https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/937,Random-Liu,Add node problem detector,"Here is a simple implementation of NodeProblemDetector for https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23028.

The node problem detector is mainly composed of two parts:
- **ProblemDetector**. It is responsible for:
  - Collecting and consolidating events and conditions from different problem daemons;
  - Translating and aggregating them into `Event`s and `NodeCondition`s;
  - Syncing with apiserver.
- **KernelMonitor** is a simple kernel log monitor for demonstrating the Node Problem API. It is one (the only one for now) of the problem daemons. It monitors the kernel log and reports problems to ProblemDetector.
  - KernelMonitor is in charge of the ""kernel condition"" node condition.
  - If there is a permanent kernel error detected, it will report ""kernel condition"" (only `KernelDeadlock` for now) with corresponding reason and message to the problem detector.
  - If there is a temporary error detected, it will report an event to the problem detector.
  - KernelMonitor uses https://github.com/hpcloud/tail to monitor the kernel log, and uses regular expression to match problems in the kernel log. The patterns of problems are configured in the config file `config/kernel-monitor.json`. Now some known kernel bugs (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20096, https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/19986) have been added, and it would be easy to support other issue only if the pattern is stable and can be expressed in regular expression.
  - A lot of TODOs:
    - Support more flexible pattern match such as only matching start&end line etc.
    - Support journald.
    - ...

The node problem detector is a DaemonSet. It needs a ConfigMap `node-problem-detector-config` generated from `config/` directory. The bootstrapping is dumb now. To start the node problem detector, you need to:
1. Make sure the config mount, kernel log mount and apiserver endpoint in node-problem-detector.yaml are properly configured.
2. Make sure the log path and issue patterns `config/kernel-monitor.json` are properly configured.
3. Create ConfigMap `node-problem-detector-config` from directory `config/`.
4. Create DaemonSet `node-problem-detector.yaml`.

Now ProblemDetector and KernelMonitor are running in the same container and of course the same DaemonSet. In the future, we may want to:
- Option 1: Move the logic of ProblemDetector into kubelet, and leave problem daemons (such as KernelMonitor) as separate DaemonSets reporting directly to kubelet.
- Option 2: Move ProblemDetector into a DaemonSet, all problem daemons run as separate DaemonSets reporting to ProblemDetector.
- Option 3: Run ProblemDetector and problem daemons in separate containers, but wrap them in one DaemonSet.

This has not been decided yet, and may need more discussion. :)

Granular roles to enable more top level playbooks to be made such as `upgrade.yml` `uninstall.yml`, etc. This breaks down the few task files into more granular files. Renamed the top level playbooks to be more descriptive, once we have more playbooks at the top level we should use something like #967 to organize the top level directory. The current issue is roles are made for a first time deployment and that is it, the role structure did not leave much room for modification / reuse in other scenarios.

The end state is to deploy each role like a 'micro-service' that has granular control so one can spin up, spin down, individual roles without having damaging effects across the cluster. All the roles should be broken down in a similar way, and broken out into their own repos. The ansible folder could have a repo called kube-ansible, or [kube-deploy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy), and each role will have its own repo that will get pulled in by kube-deploy as specified in a [requirements file](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible/blob/master/ansible-role-requirements.yml).
- Validated on Virtualbox: CoreOS & CentOS

Could you all take a glance and provide feedback? I think contrib/ansible needs to start taking steps in this direction if we want it to be usable for production deployments and be plug-able for future deployment.

I wrote the infoblox piece a while back and just realized that I need to implement the response bodies to get the IP's to pass to f5. So I'll look at that and get it cleaned up soon. 

My question for everyone else is how are you managing IP's? At my company we're using Infoblox to implement DNS & IP addresses, but want to make sure it works for everyone.

IMHO, this is not actually needed to deploy the cluster. Though, the runtime dependencies are needed to run kubernetes properly. This is relevant only for deployments when k8s is built from sources. If k8s is installed from a distribution packages, missing dependencies are already there.

So far the deps are installed only for Fedora, RHEL and CentOS. Not sure how this is handled for CoreOS or other OSes.

That is a first draft intended to improve the mungebot by implementing two specific points from #869:

> - Ping the PR due to lack of inactivity, notifying either the PR author or the assignee, depending on who last touched the PR (keep track of whose court it's in)
> - Create a way to postpone the next ping for a fixed amount of time (day, week, month, next release cycle)

This new munger comments PRs when:
- No answer has been given for 2 weeks on the PR
- No answer has been given for 2 weeks on any review (code) comment that aren't outdated.

Depending on who commented last, the added comment will either mention (@) the PR assignee or the PR owner.

The next ping can be postponed or cancelled by commenting back:
- `@k8s-merge-robot ignore inactivity`
- `@k8s-merge-robot postpone by X day(s)/week(s)/month(s)`

- allows non-gce ingress to coexist in the same cluster
- doesn't adopt complex http readiness probes as health checks (probes with headers/hosts/https)
- allows one to continue running the controller on older clusters as a pod (by fixing GCE client creation)

- `issuesRemoved` - whenever an item is removed from the queue
- `issuesTested` -- whenever an item is tested

These values will allow us to track how rate we dequeue items. This rate usually differs from both the merge rate (we remove items without merging them) as well as the change in the size of the queue (we can add items as quickly as we remove them).

This also allows us to distinguish how quickly we tend to merge things from how quickly we test things (since we can test things but not merge them if they fail tests).

A couple additional small refactorings:
- Alphabetize `submitQueueStats`
- Encapsulate deleting issues from the queue into `deleteIssue()`

# High Available Multi-Backend Load balancer

The project implements a load balancer controller that will provide a high available and load balancing access to HTTP and TCP kubernetes applications. It will support different type of loadbalancer backends ranging from software LB such as nginx, to hardward LB such as F5 and cloud LB like Openstack LBaaS.

To create a loadbalancer, users will just have to create a configmap and provide two inputs:
- Service name
- Service namespace

A configmap targeted to the loadbalancer controller would look like:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: configmap-my-service
    labels:
        app: loadbalancer
data:
    namespace: ""default""
    target-service-name: ""my-service""
```

Once the configmap is created, a new backend is create and configured to loadbalance the provided service.

Our goal is to have this controller listen to ingress events, rather than config map for generating config rules. Currently, this controller watches for configmap resources to create and configure backend. Eventually, this will be changed to watch for ingress resource instead. This feature is still being planned in kubernetes since the current version of ingress does not support layer 4 routing.

This controller is designed to easily integrate and create different load balancing backends. From software, hardware to cloud loadbalancer. Our initial featured backends are software loadbalacing (with keepalived and nginx), hardware loadbalancing with F5 and cloud loadbalancing with Openstack LBaaS v2 (Octavia).
### Software Loadbalancer via Daemon and VIPs

In the case of software loadbalancer, this controller works with loadbalancer-controller daemons which are deployed across nodes and will server as high available loadbalancers.  The loadbalancer controller will communicate with the daemons via a configmap resource.
These daemon controllers use keepalived and nginx to provide the high availability loadbalancing via the use of VIPs. VIPS are allocated to every service that's being loadbalanced. This will allow multiple services that bind to the same ports to work.
For F5 and Openstack LBaaS, the loadbalancer controllers talk to the appropriate servers via their APIs. So loadbalancer-controller daemons are not needed.
### Difference between this and [service-loadbalancer](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/service-loadbalancer) or [nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx).

Service-loadbalancer is a great option but it is only tailored for software loadbalancer using HAProxy and it is not designed in a way that it can be easily decoupled. 

The nginx ingress controller is only for nginx and only works for layer 7 applications. This project is intended to provide support for many different backends and work with all kubernetes applications (layer 7 and layer4).

Service-loadbalancer support for L4 is very limited. The binding-port needs to be open and specified as a hostPort during the controller creation. This forces the users to specify and open the ports at the beginning. This will also prevent two different services to loadbalance on the same port (ie running two mysql services). This projects uses VIPs to resolve this limitation.
## Examples:
### Software Loadbalancer using keepalived and nginx

1) First we need to create the loadbalancer controller.

```
$ kubectl create -f examples/kube-loadbalancer-rc.yaml
```

2) The loadbalancer daemon pod will only start in nodes that are labeled type: loadbalancer. Label the nodes you want the daemon to run on

```
$ kubectl label node my-node1 type=loadbalancer
```

3) Create our sample app, which consists of a service and replication controller resource: 

```
$ kubectl create -f examples/coffee-app.yaml
```

4) Create configmap for the sample app service. This will be used to configure the loadbalancer backend:

```
$ kubectl create -f coffee-configmap.yaml
```

5) Get the bind IP generated by the loadbalancer controller from the configmap.

```
$ kubectl get configmap configmap-coffee-svc -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  bind-ip: ""10.0.0.10""
  namespace: default
  target-service-name: coffee-svc
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2016-06-17T22:30:03Z
  labels:
    app: loadbalancer
  name: configmap-coffee-svc
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: ""157728""
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/configmap-coffee-svc
  uid: 08e12303-34db-11e6-87da-fa163eefe713
```

6) To access your app:

```
 $ curl http://10.0.0.10
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Hello from NGINX!</title>
  <style>
      body {
          width: 35em;
          margin: 0 auto;
          font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
  </style>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <h2>URI = /coffee</h2>
  <h2>My hostname is coffee-rc-mu9ns</h2>
  <h2>My address is 10.244.0.3:80</h2>

contrib,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/contrib/pulls/1395,https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1395,foxish,Deploying with configmaps,"Issue #1304 

This is the proposed structure and flow of how we will deploy mungegithub to multiple repositories with configmaps. The directory structure of contrib/mungegithub/submit-queue/ will look like the following:

```
.
├── deployment
│   ├── k8s-contrib
│   │   ├── configmap.yaml
│   │   ├── pvc.yaml
│   │   ├── pv.yaml
│   │   ├── secret.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   ├── k8s-kubernetes
│   │   ├── configmap.yaml
│   │   ├── pvc.yaml
│   │   ├── pv.yaml
│   │   ├── secret.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
│   └── k8s-docs
│   │   ├── configmap.yaml
│   │   ├── pvc.yaml
│   │   ├── pv.yaml
│   │   ├── secret.yaml
│   │   └── service.yaml
├── deployment.yaml
└── www
```

The makefile's deploy target would take an additional argument, the `CONFIGMAP`.  The deployment command for example, for k8s-kubernetes, the main repository like:

```
REPO=<> APP=submit-queue CONFIGMAP=k8s-kubernetes make deploy 
```

make deploy will work after one:
- creates the corresponding secret.
- creates PVC & PV if necessary.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Running as a sidecar container, git-sync needs to avoid requiring the user to confirm use of the SSH key, so we override the /usr/bin/ssh binary with our own script (ssh-wrapper.sh) that has the necessary flags, and git then uses that script by default.
- Currently, secret files are always mounted with permission 0444. This is not restrictive enough to be used as an SSH key, so we chmod the mounted secret file to 0400. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/28936 is in progress to allow for explicitly setting the permissions of a secret, and that can be incorporated into a future version of git-sync to avoid the chmod command.
- Setting the mounted secret volume with readOnly: true (as suggested in the example here: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/secrets/#use-case-pod-with-ssh-keys) actually makes it impossible to use the secret as an SSH key. As mentioned above, the secret will be mounted as 0444, but the read-only nature prevents running the necessary chmod command. I've included a warning about this in ssh.md and in the error message if the chmod fails. Again, the PR above should allow for avoiding this issue.

There are more detailed instructions for usage in the ssh.md readme, which I can move into the main README.md if that is preferred.

We were previously only ignoring ingress.class (documented here: https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/ingress/controllers/gce/BETA_LIMITATIONS.md#disabling-glbc) when the ingress was created/deleted/modified. There's a chance another ingress with the correct class results in us entering the `sync` routine and listing all ingresses. The listing routine was not smart enough to ignore `ingress.class=nginx`, so we ended up creating resources for the nginx ingress anyway. 

The second commit fixes some of the nginx examples to include a `readiness` probe that is == liveness probe.

Found a bug in my implementation of atomic pulling for git-sync in https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1356.

When using ""git worktree add"" to create a new worktree directory, that worktree directory contains a .git file instead of a .git directory. The .git file is simply a reference to a path within the root .git directory:

```
gitdir: /git/.git/worktrees/rev-...
```

Because that reference path is absolute, any other container that attempts to run a git command inside the worktree will fail if the volume was mounted under a different name. For example, if another container mounts the volume at /repo and then tries to run a git command in one of the worktree directories within /repo, it will fail because the .git file in that worktree will point to a /git path that doesn't exist.

To avoid the bug, we overwrite the .git file in the worktree to use a relative path instead of an absolute path.

```
gitdir: ../.git/worktrees/rev-...
```

    - u3
  team/t3:

This should let us use OWNERs files better with an extra level of indirection.
Things that need further thought:
1. Do we want to support nested team definitions like above? (If yes, what do we do if there are cyclic loops?)
2. Should the yaml file containing aliases be within the repository, or be globally consistent and supplied to mungegithub at the time of invocation?

On the other hand, if the addons role is run, functioning master is required in advance.

The DaemonSet runs a small go program that is mostly a wrapper around `apparmor_parser`, which actually loads the profiles. The additional features the loader provides are:
- Polling
- Sourcing from multiple directories
- Better handling of symlinks (necessary for ConfigMap volumes)
- Better logging and messaging

This is meant to provide an example of using AppArmor, and be a starting point for users trying out AppArmor or building there own solutions.

ansible installs on distros capable of package installation.
For CoreOS, this is worked-around by running python in a container.

This commit extends the same workaround to Fedora Atomic (the
workaround isn't needed for CentOS Atomic, because its image
already includes PyYAML.)

The commit changes the check for whether the workaround is required
from ""is python here"" to ""is pyyaml importable."" This is necessary
because Fedora does include python, so just checking for python
isn't sufficient to trigger the workaround.

I tested this on coreos and on fedora atomic.

What?
This PR adds ApprovalHandler that will try to add ""approved"" label once all files of change has been approved by approvers.

```
// The algorithm goes as:
// - Initially, we set up approverMap
//   - Go through all comments after latest commit. If any approver said ""/approve"", add him to approverMap.
// - For each file, we see if any approver of this file is in approverMap.
//   - An approver of a file is defined as:
//     - It's known that each dir has a list of approvers. (This might not hold true. For usability, current situation is enough.)
//     - Approver of a dir is also the approver of child dirs.
//   - We look at only top 3 dir level's approvers .
// - Iff all files has been approved, the bot will add ""approved"" label.
```

Adding support for multiple commands on URLs for [exec-healthz](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/exec-healthz).

Example as below:

```
$ ./exechealthz --cmd=""ls /tmp/test1"" --url=""/healthz1"" --cmd=""ls /tmp/test2"" --url=""/healthz2""
```

The --url flag indicates the path healthz server needs to serve on.
Notes: Number of cmds and URLs have to be the same (if more than 1). URL need to start with ""/"". URLs and cmds match up based on their orders (first URL to first cmd).

The previous behavior remains the same (as the previous examples in README).

Description from the previous PR:

When using nginx as a proxy we can run into the following error:

```
upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream
```

In order to fix this, we need to be able to configure the proxy_buffer_size nginx directive to increase its value. This PR updates the nginx-ingress-controller to allow that.

Current `dnsmasq` container exit immediately after docker sends STOPSIGNAL. In order to support graceful termination as kubernetes/kubernetes#31807 indicated, we need to delay this operation.

Similar to that we do in `kubedns` --- ignoring the SIGTERM and exit when SIGKILL from docker occurs, @thockin's solution is to redirect docker's STOPSIGNAL to SIGCONT. I did a couple rounds of test and it works as expected.

The tag should be bumped up when we need to get the graceful termination feature in.

- change the layout of the packages to be agnostic to the backend (first step)
- remove most of the references to nginx
- remove unnecessary function exports
- add test 
- refactor how the status of the Ingress rules are keep up to date (using leader election)
- move main inside cmd package

My wish is that to implement a new controller (like caddy) you just need to write a template for the tool, calling the generic code and a Dockerfile

You don't need to say ""ok to test"" anymore, ""@k8s-bot test this"" works. The only case we don't hit anymore is if you apply the lgtm label without saying anything, which we can fix elsewhere. In the meantime, lets fix the world.

By default the following locations are available through the internet:
- http://host:10251/configz
- http://host:10251/debug/pprof/heap
- http://host:10252/configz
- http://host:10252/debug/pprof/heap
- http://host:10255/metrics
- http://host:4194
- https://host:10250
- http://host:10255

Let's reduce probability to access them.

Forcing kubelet to listen the localhost interface results in inaccessible `kubectl exec` and `kubectl logs`. I'm trying to resolve this issue within https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/35693

Anyway it is recommended to set the following custom variables:
- `private_interface: ""eth0""`
- `kubelet_bind_address: ""{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_'+private_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}""`
- `has_iptables: true`

And then `kubectl exec` and `kubectl logs` will work flawlessly.

It  is entirely based on Heat. It utilizes Heat ResourceGroups (or AutoScalingGroups) to resize groups of instances that form a cluster of minions.

The rough idea is that the user specifies the name of the resource group (and Heat stack it is contained in) that should be auto-scaled when the autoscaler is started, like this:

```
min:max:resource-group:stack-name:size-param-name
```

The OpenStack-heat cloudprovider implementation then takes care of updating the parameters of the Heat stack in order to resize the ResourceGroup, based on the already existing auto-scaler policies (unschedulable pods, etc...).

I'll be happy to contribute this if you are interested :)

The commit contains no vendored dependencies, to ease up the review.

P.S.: I realize the new [Senlin](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Senlin) service is better suited to autoscaling, but it is quite new and there are still no golang SDKs for it. I'd be happy to introduce a Senlin autoscaler later on, once it becomes more wide-spread (as there are currently many OpenStack installations that support Heat but not Senlin).

This expands this to two additional strategies:

- Most Pods - choose the node group that can schedule the most pods, usually due to predicate rules
- Least Waste - choose the node group that has the least remaining CPU resources after a scale up, and if that is tied, the least remaining Memory

In the event of a tie, both of these strategies fall back to the current Random method.

This probably needs test coverage, to move to its own package, and there could be some weirdness in the algorithms as it needs manual testing.

monitoring, which is a very small subset of what Prometheus is able to
do. Furthermore it is incorrect as Prometheus expects everything to be
whitebox monitored as `instance` labels are otherwise incorrectly set,
and therefore results in an ambiguous source of a metric.

Prometheus has a built-in Kubernetes Service Discovery mechanism which
can be used to discover targets to perform whitebox monitoring. However,
even though all targets can be discovered with that mechanism, it is not
a one-size-fits-all solution and thus still requires deep knowledge of
the way Prometheus is configured.

The Prometheus Operator manages Prometheus instances and integrates its
configuration natively into Kubernetes using third party resources.

The Prometheus Helm Chart provides another alternative.

Please read the discussion in the issue to see more context.

@andrewsykim @Raffo @mwielgus Would you mind reviewing this? :bow:

TODOs:

- [x] Add unit tests

Non-TODOs:

- Automatic creation of configmaps filled with defaults, like cluster-proportional-autoscaler does with `--configmap` with `--default-params`. IMHO doing so is a completely orthogonal issue therefore won't be addressed in this PR.

---

This PR adds a new optional flag named `configmap` to specify the name of a configmap containing node group specs.

The configmap is polled every `scan-interval` seconds to reconfigure cluster-autoscaler dynamically at runtime.

Example usage:

```
./cluster-autoscaler --v=4 --cloud-provider=aws --skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false --logtostderr --leader-elect=false --configmap=cluster-autoscaler --logtostderr
```

The configmap would look like:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: cluster-autoscaler
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  settings: |-
    {
      ""nodeGroups"": [
        {
          ""minSize"": 1,

          ""name"": ""kubeawstest-nodepool1-AutoScaleWorker-1VWD4GAVG35L5""

1. People could install k8s without install docker by adding flag `--skip-tags=docker`
So here comes the potential problem, once the docker was installed before and configured, the prefix string `DOCKER_OPTS=` may already exsit , the string ` /run/flannel/subnet.env` may not exsit.
in this situation,  ` /run/flannel/subnet.env`  will written in the end of file after `DOCKER_OPTS=` so that the network configuration not work.

Initial PR for redis-cache (no persistence) with automatic master-slave promotion.  

If you think this looks okay, i will add the source-code and docker files for other utilities.  

for this petset to work, i have changed the peer-finder little bit, i think it will be better if we factor-out peer-finder as a package instead of a utility.  I could do this as a part of separate PR.

The idea was that they would be ""secure by default"" by using the `whitelist-source-range` to the config map.

I forgot that source IPs are mangled on AWS and by default on other cloud providers so it didn't matter in the end.

This PR fixes the following error I found in the logs when trying to set the `whitelist-source-range` in the config map:

contrib,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/contrib/pulls/2348,https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/2348,Capitrium,Add Least-Cost Node Group Expander,"#2118 added support for node group expansion strategies, allowing the cluster autoscaler to determine the best node group to expand instead of just selecting a node group at random. This adds a new expansion strategy that selects the node group with the lowest price per node as the group to be expanded, falling back to random selection if the price per node is equal across all configured node groups.

The main purpose of this PR is to improve support for AWS spot instance nodes; as GCE does not provide a bidding . Consider the following snippet from a cluster-autoscaler deployment manifest:
```
        - ./cluster-autoscaler
        - --v=4
        - --cloud-provider=aws
        - --expander=least-cost
        - --nodes=1:10:spot-node-1
        - --nodes=1:10:spot-node-2
        - --nodes=1:10:spot-node-3
        - --nodes=1:10:spot-node-4
        - --nodes=1:10:on-demand-node:0.10
```
Each of the spot worker groups spans a single Availability Zone on AWS. As instances are added to the spot worker groups, the current market price for spot instances in a given AZ is likely to change. Using the least-cost expander allows the cluster autoscaler to take the market price of spot instances into account when scaling, causing it to select the node group with the cheapest spot price at the time the scale-up was requested.

Note the additional on-demand node group; since there is no simple API for getting the current on-demand price of an AWS instance type, the node cost is manually specified as part of the node group. This way, if the spot price in all AZs is higher than the max bid price configured for the spot node groups, the cluster autoscaler can fall back to the on-demand node group.

Since GCE doesn't use a variable pricing model for their discounted Preemptible VMs, configuring the cluster autoscaler to add support for them should be trivial:
```
        - ./cluster-autoscaler
        - --v=4
        - --cloud-provider=gce
        - --expander=least-cost
        - --nodes=1:10:preemptible-node-1:0.20
        - --nodes=1:10:preemptible-node-2:0.20
        - --nodes=1:10:preemptible-node-3:0.20
        - --nodes=1:10:preemptible-node-4:0.20
        - --nodes=1:10:regular-node:1.00

The script works by bringing up a busybox pod on the same node as the debug target, mounting the node's root fs, and calling docker directly to copy busybox into the target container. Once the ""install"" is complete, the target can be debugged through a standard `kubectl exec`.

It adds support for configurable keepalived _virtual router id_.   This functionality is necessary in order to be able to run multiple keepalived ""clusters"" in the same subnet without having them stepping on each other's toes (having one node from one group confusing the other group into thinking it has a master).

The configuration of the _virtual router id_ is done using the `--router-id` command line flag. I considered using the project's _configmap_ but the structure of the existing _configmap_ is not easily expandable, so I had to use a flag (I would have added support for environment variables, but it didn't seems to be in line with the way this application is thought out, so I refrained).

The flag can be specified in a k8s object with the `args` key, for example:
`- args: [""--services-configmap=admin/vip-configmap"", ""--router-id=45""]`

If not specified, it will default to router id _50_ as it was before.

1. The fluent-plugin-systemd regression was fixed in 0.0.8 (https://github.com/reevoo/fluent-plugin-systemd/issues/32)
2. `libc-dev` is an alias for `libc6-dev`, which works on install but not purge for some reason, so a couple build dependencies were being left behind. Changing to `libc6-dev` solves this.
3. All other gem & package changes are just updates since the last image was built.

It adds support for configurable keepalived virtual router id. This functionality is necessary in order to be able to run multiple keepalived ""clusters"" in the same subnet without having them stepping on each other's toes (having one node from one group confusing the other group into thinking it has a master).

The configuration of the virtual router id is done using the --vrid command line flag. I considered using the project's configmap but the structure of the existing configmap is not easily expandable, so I had to use a flag (I would have added support for environment variables, but it didn't seems to be in line with the way this application is thought out, so I refrained).

The flag can be specified in a k8s object with the args key, for example:
- args: [""--services-configmap=admin/vip-configmap"", ""--vrid=45""]

If not specified, it will default to router id 50 as it was before.

---

This is an alternative implementation of #1982

Notable differences from the original PR are:

* A new flag named `--node-group-auto-discovery` is introduced for opting in to enable the auto-discovery feature.
  * For example, specifying `--cloud-provider aws --node-group-auto-discovery asg:tag=k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled` instructs CA to auto-discover ASGs tagged with `k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled` to be used as target node groups
* The new code path introduced by this PR is executed only when `node-group-auto-discovery` is specified. There is relatively less chance to break existing features by this change

Other notes:

* ~~I thought it might be a good idea to implement this feature on top of the dynamic reconfiguration #2181 initially~~
  * ~~However it turned out it is easier and less verbose to just implement an alternative aws cloud provider like what I've done for this PR~~
* We rely mainly on the `DescribeTags` API rather than `DescribeAutoScalingGroups` so that AWS can filter out unnecessary ASGs which doesn't belong to the k8s cluster, for us.
  * If we relied on `DescribeAutoScalingGroups` here, as it doesn't support `Filter`ing, we'd need to iterate over ALL the ASGs available in an AWS account, which isn't desirable due to unnecessary excessive API calls and network usages

Possible future improvements before recommending this to everyone:

* Cache the result of an auto-discovery for a configurable period, so that we won't invoke DescribeTags and DescribeAutoScalingGroup APIs too many times

We should make these changes here and get rid of the configmap in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/51302, because configmaps have no good update strategy.  Specifically, if the master version changes, the configmap will change, but pods making up the daemonset won't get restarted (unless the version of the container changed as well), so they won't update their config (the configmap volume may change, but nginx won't reload it).

This isn't a really good fix because almost any time that you fix a race condition by using a sleep there's something wrong.

k.started definitely should not be set to true before the k.cmd.Start() call.

Anyone got a better solution to the sleep? I thought about waiting on the PID file creation by keepalived but unfortunately by code inspection keepalived creates that file before the signal handler is installed so to truly fix the race condition we would need an upstream fix in keepalived.

Diving in deeper the issue seems to be related to the `modprobe ip_vs` from https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/8be3a141fd0d753ddcd8cbc23b74cbdd430394ba/keepalived-vip/utils.go#L232

When running this manually inside the container this returns the following error:
```
root@172:/# modprobe ip_vs; echo $?
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'ip_vs': Exec format error
1
```
I don't know what exactly causes this error, but it seems to be an incompatibility between the 'container' modprobe and the 'host' modprobe:

```
# container
root@172:/# uname -a
Linux 172.28.128.30 3.10.0-693.5.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Oct 20 20:32:50 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@172:/# modprobe --version
kmod version 22
-XZ -ZLIB -EXPERIMENTAL 
```

```
# host
[root@172 ~]# modprobe --version
kmod version 20
```

So I've tried this workaround using an `initContainer`, which actually works as expected.","['bowei', 'bprashanth']",1,2017-11-15 13:02:22,,2019-04-04 21:15:51,False,,,unstable,True,open

- Removed mounting of entire host root filesystem to /mnt/rootfs as it's not

- Fixed a stderr redirection bug that caused log line to be saved as a file.

i modified keepalived-vip to add an option to use notify scripts. 
My change should be 100% backwards compatible to the previous behavior. 
It is enabled by mounting your notification script to the pod via a configmap, and then setting the env var `KEEPALIVED_NOTIFY` to the location where it is mounted. This will include  a line like:
`notify /opt/your-notify-script.sh` to the keepalived config.

It is a PR to show the idea that it maybe good to introduce `timeout` option.

The command itself sometimes hangs up for some reasons (e.g. network IO) and may run forever. It should be good to implement timeout in commands; however sometimes it is difficult to make changes to commands and cover every cases. Since timeout could be a general case, I would like to see it is implemented in `exec-healthz`.

Motivation: according to [trunc code](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaConfig.scala#L1117) (which describes in quite a vague fashion in [official documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs)) log.dir section of configuration is used as a topic log directory if and only if log.dirs is not present. However, default /opt/kafka_2.11-0.10.2.0/config/server.properties from current gcr.io/google-samples/k8skafka contains entry of log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs, so override does nothing useful and in fact is very misleading, producing probable data loss, when mounting external volume to /var/lib/kafka.",['kow3ns'],1,2018-09-17 12:49:09,2019-03-25 12:10:23,2019-03-25 12:10:24,False,,,unknown,,closed
