kube-deploy,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pulls/5,https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pull/5,justinsb,WIP: simple configuration & metaconfiguration tool,"@mikedanese here is an example of a much simpler way to specify configuration.  We have a simple go installer program, that walks a directory tree, and interprets that as task (ala Salt or Ansible).  We have tasks that are a little smarter / more specialized for our use case than Salt or Ansible, such that most of the complexity here goes away.

So here we have a zero-dependency installer, with a very readable (IMO) installation specification.  There are obviously still issues to resolve, e.g. the generation of options is funky, but I think we could use jsonnet for that.

The nice thing here is that this ""filesystem tree as specification"" is simple enough that it would be trivial to transform this into salt, ansible, or whatever people want.

But, at the same time, by having a simple golang tool that works without external dependencies we can package this however we want - in a container, running directly on the host, running over SSH/SFTP etc.

I previously proposed this into kubernetes/contrib as https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/486, but this seems a better place for it.

I extended the tool to support GCE images also.  We don't currently have a public Debian Jessie image on GCE that has the cgroups memory controller enabled (this was the root problem that required the custom image in the first place on AWS as well).

Most of this PR is code to bring up an instance, from which we can then run the bootstrap-vz tool.  I would like to replace that code with the code that will be in the cloudup tool to bring up clouds.  But - for now - getting cloudup & nodeup depends on a working image, so I think this sequence makes sense...

To try, just edit `state/kubernetes.yaml` and then run

```
go install k8s.io/kube-deploy/fastdeploy... &&  ~/k8s/bin/cloudup --v=8
```

You should have a cluster on GCE.  (do `--dryrun` first to see what it will do); also you will need to build an image using my other PR.

That is ""direct"" mode, where cloudup runs directly against the APIs, and uses nodeup which a golang tool that applies the configuration directly.

But not everyone will want to use our own tools.  So we can also build configurations for other systems.  Currently terraform is implemented:

```
go install k8s.io/kube-deploy/fastdeploy... &&  ~/k8s/bin/cloudup --v=8 --target=terraform > tf/k8s.tf.json
```

Then do a `terraform apply` and the cluster will come up.

We can pull the same trick for nodeup.  The `nodeup` program itself has a `--target` flag, but normally you won't want to do that.  Instead, cloudup embeds nodeup, and you can specify `NodeInit: cloudinit` in the `state/kubernetes.yaml` directory.  I recommend doing this with --target=terraform so you can easily see what happens.  Sadly this is currently untested, because the GCE jessie images don't use cloud-init.

Ref: #10 

The scripts here are refactored, but this hasn't been merged into Kuberenetes core, so we should review it and test it here.
I'm sure there are bugs around (haven't touched this for about two months), so feel free to comment on it.

The docs around this are just unorganized, mostly outdated and kind of ugly.
We should link to guides in the docs for example instead of having a testing section here
We should discuss how this updates should be made to the `docs` repo when updating something here etc.

It should be much easier to run this guide too, and I'm proposing to have just one script (we may call it kube-up or whatever) instead of many small (master, worker, etc)
This doesn't work with `docker-1.11`
We should use @ArtfulCoder's one-container DNS solution instead of the current one I think

And the long-term goal would probably to be to write this purely in Go instead.

I will update this when I have time, and when we have an initial draft, let's merge it.

features to kubelet, such as independent mounting of disks or copying of
resources from S3.  protokube lets us develop those features prior to
moving them into kubelet.

In particular, today we need to mount an EBS volume on the master prior
to starting kubelet, if we want to run the master in an ASG.

protokube is a service that runs on boot, and it tries to mount the
master volume.  Once it mounts the master volume, it runs kubelet.
Currently it runs kubelet by looking at a directory
/etc/kubernetes/bootstrap; the intention is that we could actually have
multiple versions of kubelet in here (or other services) and then we
could automatically roll-back from a failed update.

kube-deploy,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pulls/106,https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pull/106,colemickens,min-turnup: azure,"I changed:
- `--service-cluster-ip-range` to not overlap with the ip range that will be used for the actual nodes.
- changed the manifest templates to jinja2, it was easier to do the syntax I needed for adding the `--cloud-config` flag
- changed the master pod manifests to use `hyperkube-amd64` instead of the `kube-{apiserver,scheduler,controller-manager}` images. `kubelet.service` was already using `hyperkube-amd64` so it's already on box, plus it makes it easier for me to test changes to cloudprovider if I only have to rebuild and upload hyperkube instead of 4+ containers.
- added a `Dockerfile` that has `terraform`, `jq`, `jsonnet`, etc. (especially since this relies of a pre-release version of terraform [https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/6803]).

This worksaround Azure's lack of metadata service by using terraform's `template_file` functionality. I use terraform's `base64encode` and `file` functions to access the contents of the crypto assets and use `template_file` to interpolate them into a `configure-vm.sh` template that is rendered and passed as `custom_data` to the VM. Similarly it passes through some environment information and Active Directory credentials that are required by the `cloudprovider` implementation. The `template_file` approach was chosen instead of using the `remote-exec` and `file` provisioners in terraform because they don't work easily for Azure currently: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/7122.

This relies on the `azure` `cloudprovider`, so it current defaults to my own `hyperkube-amd` repo/image. (I'm blocked on sending the PR for the `cloudprovider` for reasons... but hopefully that will stop being a thing soon)

It should probably include a script to help create the Azure Service Principal that could then be used by Terraform and passed through for `cloudprovider`.

So, it's not ready to merge yet for reasons mentioned above, but I wanted to get this out for any comments. I was able to deploy a 20 cluster on the first try after getting the single master/node working: http://i.imgur.com/boyFZsw.png.

The biggest issue I see is that `addons` seem to be unaddressed. For now I haven't added `kube-proxy` as a manifest pod since I assume we're going to run it via a `DaemonSet` addon....

This builds upon https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/issues/176
Since CNI has been merged into `docker-multinode` with https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pull/115, it would be great to have self hosted flannel and kube-proxy as daemon-sets. That is what this pull request is about.

Most of the work for this is in the hyperkube: see PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/29848, which goes hand in hand with this one.

The biggest issue is how to cleanly propagate configuration (such as the MASTER_IP) to the daemonsets.

I've tested this in a two node setup, all addons were running correctly and I managed to deploy the guestbook example without issues.

In the end the easiest/best way in my eyes was just updating the underlying dependencies, where this was already included. This took included the following steps:
- Pull bootstrap-vz from upstream instead of from @justinsb's fork
- Add the new boto3 requirement
- Use the boto3 syntax for the AWS keys
- Update the version number of the ixgbevf to be removed - we prefer to use the in-kernel driver (see issue linked above)
- Use the latest debian 8.7 jessie images to start from, adding a few new regions while doing so

The upstream master already includes config to install the latest [AWS ENA drivers](https://github.com/andsens/bootstrap-vz/blob/master/bootstrapvz/providers/ec2/tasks/network.py#L126) and set the [--ena-support flag](https://github.com/andsens/bootstrap-vz/blob/master/bootstrapvz/providers/ec2/tasks/ami.py#L128) on the AMI 

An image built with this config from my account cant be found in us-east-1 as ami-7cdee507 (which should be public).

- tautology - we know that the group will hold API definitions.
- consistency - all other main k8s groups have a single word subdomain:
  storage.k8s.io, networking.k8s.io and etc..
- bug in [code-generator][0] that prevents clientset generation when

- do it early that late.

Repercussions for this change will be that existing API resources needs
to be recreated - CRDs, Machines and Clusters.

A few notes:

1. It's clear to me that K8s values e2e over unit tests. So we shouldn't be aiming for high coverage here, but instead testing critical/complex pieces of logic.
2. I can't add all such unit tests myself, so I'll need help from contributors.

First stab at using an existing 3p package for retries/timeout using https://github.com/cenkalti/backoff which seems to be widely used and mature. I've implemented the new retry for 3 steps:

1. Get and write kubeconfig
2. Wait for apiserver
3. Wait for service account

Next step would be to use it for GCE calls as well. (#407)

Relying on the cluster lister can sometimes cause the machine reconcicliation to fail without being able to find a cluster since the machine creation event can be received before the cluster creation event. Normally this doesn't matter because it is retried in a loop. It is, however, causing the unit test to flake about 2% of the time.  This refactor makes the test more reliable (0 failures out of 500). The difference may not seem like much, but will become annoying when PR testing is turned on.

Outside of testing concerns, we would likely have to make sure we fetch the latest version of the cluster anyway like we do for machine elsewhere. This also allows for getCluster to locate the cluster based on the machine in the future when we change how machines and clusters are associated as #609 proposes.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: this PR brings an initial implementation of `MachineSet` controller. It watches for `MachineSet` resources and makes sure that the current state is equal to the desired one. At the moment the current state of the cluster is calculated based on the number of machines that are owned by the given machineSet resource. This essentially means that newly created resources have their `OwnerReferences`  field set to the given `MachineSet` resource.

kube-deploy,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pulls/649,https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/pull/649,krousey,Break the machine controller's dependency on Google Actuator,"This changes the machine controller library to take the machine actuator as a parameter and not construct it based on a flag an factory function. This allows a higher level package to provide an implementation to the library without the library having an import dependency on it.

As an example, I wrote a ext-apiserver/cloud/cmd/gce-machine-controller that passes in the GCE machine actuator. It's less than 40 lines of code. There's nothing special about the actuator's implementation being in-tree here.

This does modify some of the auto-generated code. It changes the way a machine controller is constructed in `ext-apiserver/pkg/controller/machine/zz_generated.api.register.go` to take an actuator as a parameter. It also changes `ext-apiserver/pkg/controller/zz_generated.api.register.go` to remove the machine controller from the set of all controllers that will be pulled into generic controller-manager binary.

This change is not complete, but enough to get the idea across. Specifically tests and the gce deployer need updating, and a new docker image for the new controller need to be created.

Are we OK with a change like this?

The other is that it provides us a place to drop alternative representations, in particular machine classes.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
In order to maintain type parity for providerConfig across both Machine
and Cluster types, change the ClusterSpec.ProviderConfig to the
ProviderConfig type.

Additionally, as all changes to the API require regenerating code, add a
Makefile that will simplify that process.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Previous work to develop a Makefile that would handle API autogenerated
code was less than ideal. This change backs those changes out and solves
this in a more supportable way.

This change adds a one-time Dockerfile that will build an image with the
necessary api generation dependencies and runs against the local source
tree.

In addition, this removes the dependency on conversion-gen source.

tests that mock GCP Compute Service calls.

Add a flag `-addtags` to allow specifying one or more additional tags to be injected into the `imagebuilder` configuration when using AWS. This has two purposes:

1. users operating in the same AWS account can use tags to select images

2. it also allows injecting extra runtime config into the `bootstrap-vz` templates. Possibly best explained with an example from my employer's internal CI job:

```
---
{{- define ""gitref"" -}}
{{- $ref := or .Tags.GitRef """" -}}
{{- if ne $ref ""master"" -}}
{{- printf ""%s"" $ref -}}
{{- end -}}

For EC2 m5/c5 families, EBS volumes are exposed as NVMe block devices.
If there's a delay for AWS EBS to respond, we can reach NVMe IO timeout.
When this happens, the disk is re-mounted as read-only and no further writes can happen.
The default is 30 seconds.
AWS recommends to set it as high as possible. The newest Amazon Linux has this configured too.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html#timeout-nvme-ebs-volumes
For the kernel version, the highest value is 255.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/5694

**Release note**:
```release-note
Increase nvme io timeout to better support EC2 c5/m5 instances.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

acpi-support is needed for AWS to trigger systemd shutdown jobs
on instance shutdown or termination

Without acpi-support, the instance just gets hard powered off
approx 5 minutes after termination event fires without tidying
up at all

Adds acpi-support to 1.10 and 1.11 stretch images. This causes the instance to recognise that it is being shut down, allowing shutdown scripts to fire, and possibly reducing instance termination time.

`imagebuilder` passes through AWS creds to the target instance. When the target instance is started with an IAM role specified in the instance profile, passthru-creds are almost certainly not what the user actually wants; it makes it unnecessarily efforty to do AWS things in the `bootstrap-vz` config.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**

No obviously-relevant issues found when I searched

I'm actually a little surprised by this and it leaves me wondering if anyone else actually uses the `InstanceProfile` option I added! Without this change it's really annoying to use. Sorry :-(

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

Should have no effect on configurations without IAM roles. We've been running our daily build pipeline with this change for months, I just forgot to feed it back upstream. Cheers! 🍻 

**Release note**:

```release-note
Don't pass-thru AWS creds when IAM role specified in EC2 instance profile

However, it does address some real-world problems.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

2.5 things convinced me to submit this PR:

* There haven't been any new Debian/jessie AMIs recently. The most recent (`ami-221ea342`) was created on 2017-01-15. This means a new AMI build host started now would be missing nearly two years of security patches
* My private `imagebuilder` AMI pipeline stopped working with `pip` failures related to `urllib3`. I was not able to get it working again with Debian/jessie. I was able to replicate these issues in a `debian:jessie` Docker container locally by copy/pasting the commands from `imagebuilder/pkg/imagebuilder/config.go`, so figured it wasn't my pipeline (which had been working fine for months) at fault
* the AWS Paris region was not obviously supported 

This commit:

* switches to current (as of time of writing) Debian/stretch AMIs (as listed: https://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image/Stretch)
* adds AWS Paris region `eu-west-3`
* explicitly installs Python `requests` module
* forces `pip` to upgrade things during module installation if possible

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:

Did not find any relevant issues

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

My private `imagebuilder` pipeline has been building AWS AMIs with this change since submitting it. No GCP testing, however.

**Release note**:

```release-note
ACTION REQUIRED: imagebuilder buildhosts now use Debian/stretch. This may affect operations run outside the target filesystem (ie. no chroot) in the build template
Add a default AMI for AWS Paris (`eu-west-3`) region
```

* while working on `bootstrap-vz` I branched from @andsens' current [`master`](https://github.com/andsens/bootstrap-vz) branch.
