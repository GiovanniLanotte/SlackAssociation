I'm advocating for repo removal rather than repo archival because there's nothing in the repo in question except for some boilerplate. 

 I started a thread on k8s-steering because the repo seemed ownerless (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2464), and opened an issue asking whether the repo was necessary (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/common/issues/8)

### Describe what is attempting to be accomplished
Now that the kubernetes-csi repos have branch protection applied, it's become clear that a few of them aren't getting the cla/linuxfoundation check.  Turns out this check has been enabled as webhooks on a per-repo basis rather than at the org level.  We should go through and remove the per-repo hooks, and setup the org-wide hook.

- https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/pull/18
- https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/pull/24

New Repo (?) (Migrating [a directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/kind) out of https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra)

### Requested name for new repository
`kind` would be ideal, it's the tool's name now, seems to not be in use elsewhere and is a good CLI / install path.

kind == Kubernetes IN Docker (see blow)

### Which Organization should it reside
kubernetes-sigs -- this is a sig-testing project

### Who should be provided access to this repository
e.g (at)example_user should have write access

- @bentheelder - I'd like at least write access (admin? owner? whatever is acceptable), I initially authored and currently maintain / actively develop  this project
- @munnerz - should also have identical access to @bentheelder (munnerz is a co-`approver` and key contributor)
- @krzyzacy and @amwat - should at least be collaborators in the kubernetes-sigs org, they are test-infra maintainers and `kind` `reviewer`s currently

### Approvals
This is a SIG repository, I requested a vote by email and in the SIG weekly meeting for sig-testing:

- Three SIG-Testing leads voted in favor of this here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-testing/DcvxFVaGqGo
- This was additionally discussed in the sig-testing meeting today with support. I'll add a link once the video is available. EDIT: here it is https://youtu.be/av3eFyyFryA


### Additional context for request
Per the sig discussion, we've incubated this in test-infra under sig-testing, but we'd like to move it out (and in the future other parts of test-infra), and set up CI for it there without bogging down PRs to the test-infra config and other tools etc. We also need a way to version it back to `kubetest` which is in test-infra, so moving it out seems like the way to solve this.

### Additional context for request
Currently, kubernetes-incubator/external-storage houses both a small library under /lib for writing external provisioners and a number of ""community-maintained"" provisioners which depend on the library. We want to separate the library and the provisioners.

It can be difficult for users/dependers of the library to vendor it and for library maintainers to update it (as frequently as versions of kubernetes are released) due to the need to untangle golang dependency webs if/when conflicts arise.

@quinton-hoole, @quinton-hoole-2

### Describe the issue
Due to a 2FA snarfu I've temporarily (for 6 months) lost access to my quinton-hoole github account.  So I'm now quinton-hoole-2.  @spiffxp could I ask you to please grant quinton-hoole-2 the same github permissions as quinton-hoole has, across all repos in the kubernetes/* orgs?  

Best leave quinton-hoole as is, because I'll hopefully switch back to that account in 6 months, once the github grace period has expired.  Weird, I know, but that's how it works.  

Many thanks in advance...

The following localization repositories:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-docs-ja

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-docs-zh

And their associated teams:

```

 @kubernetes/kubernetes-docs-ko-admins
 @kubernetes/kubernetes-docs-ko-maintainers
 @kubernetes/kubernetes-docs-zh-admins

org,justaugustus,https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/164,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/org/issues/164,Enable FOSSA license scanning across all Kubernetes orgs,"### Organization or repository
All k8s orgs

### Name of integration
FOSSA

### Link to integration website
- https://fossa.io/
- https://github.com/fossas/fossa-docs/blob/master/src/md/getting-started/repository-permissions.md

### Describe what is attempting to be accomplished
As a project, we'd like to be able to scan software licenses with some framework and it seems the general consensus has been to use FOSSA.
There are multiple tracking issues and threads to catch up on, so I'll point there instead:
- Open `k/steering` issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/57
- Umbrella `k/sig-release` tracking: https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/223
- Older `k/steering` issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/21

### What SIG and subproject does this fall under in sigs.yaml
subproject for sig-cluster-lifecycle
note: Kubespray is already listed in the sigs.yaml

### Approvals

- [x] @timothysc 
- [x] @justinsb 

### Additional context for request

Kubespray is today one of the most active projects by many metrics in the kubernetes/* orgs ([k8s.devstats.cncf.io](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/49/github-stats-by-repository?orgId=1&var-stat=commits&from=now-90d&to=now)), it has more 300+ contributors and many users. 
As the incubator org is deprecated and the project is still very active, the sig cluster-lifecycle agreed to host it in kubernetes-sigs.

i've been contributing k/k for about a year. (mostly active in sig api-machinery) and know how the codebase runs especially for k/k apiserver for recent releases. 

i'm joining this org to help maintaining [apiserver-builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/apiserver-builder). even tho this repo has been officially deprecated, it still need bandwidth for compatibility w/ legacy external AA servers. i will update its vendor w/ k/k and collect minor patches for the repo (by which i mean excluding features).

sig-storage

### Approvals
Need sig-storage approval from: @childsb, @saad-ali and @msau42
See ""Break out local-provisioner from external-storage repo"" in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t4z5DYKjX2ZDlkTpCnp18icRAQqOE85C1T1r2gqJVck/edit#gid=1566770776

### Additional context for request
Current, kubernetes-incubator/external-storage houses a lot of different provisioners. Different provisioners may have theirs own dependency/ci requirements, etc. For dependency management, it resulted that external-storage repo has huge dependency chain, and updating dependencies for one provisioner requires updating it for all provisioners which is not convenient and may have risk. So we are going to break out local-provisioner from external-storage repo first.

No objections in threads or 11/27 SIG-Windows meeting, so we have lazy consensus.

### Additional context for request
Testing Windows nodes needs extra container images to be built that are not currently built from kubernetes/kubernetes or kubernetes/test-infra.

This repo will hold the code that's built by SIG-Windows until we can find a way to merge it into the main project, or eliminate the need for them.

### What should the repo description be
A universal operator that generates and runs operators based on a standard data format.

Associated proposal: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/pull/489

### What SIG and subproject does this fall under in sigs.yaml
This is part of the kubebuilder subproject for SIG API Machinery.

### Approvals
kubebuilder subproject core maintainers should approve this repo:

- [x] pwittrock
- [x] droot
- [x] DirectXMan12

### Additional context for request
While Kubebuilder provides an abstraction around the plumbing for building operators, there is still a lot of work to implement operators in code. To combat this problem, Mesosphere built an SDK for DC/OS, as well as a package data format, that handles a lot of the common high level tasks in running stateful workloads and provides lifecycle hooks. The purpose of Maestro is to take this work and enable the same standard packaging format and lifecycle hooks to be applied to Kubernetes operators.

### When should this be done
Anytime

### Additional context for request

This repo was created as part of https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/92.

However, SIG storage ended up never using it because Openstack folks who own and maintain Cinder already have a repo: https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/tree/master/pkg/csi/cinder.

So no need to ""archive"" `github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-cinder` -- just delete it.

### Additional context for request
Current, kubernetes-incubator/external-storage houses a lot of different provisioners. Different provisioners may have theirs own dependency/ci requirements or development/release workflow, etc. As for dependency management, it resulted that external-storage repo has huge dependency chain, and updating dependencies for one provisioner requires updating it for all provisioners which is not convenient and may have risk.

I was unable to find an issue to point to for ""we intend to one day automate team membership via peribolos"" so now I've gone and created one.

I have used peribolos in the past to mass-create some teams for kubernetes-csi repos, but it wasn't a very friendly experience.  I used a file to generate the teams and populate members/maintainers, but I still had to go through and manually assign ACLs to repos.  

Ultimately I think we want to make this a self-service experience akin to test-infra's config/jobs directory, where files are sharded and OWNERS files allow sigs to control their thing.  But I hazily recall we have discussed in the past the idea of iterating with one massive file per org to start with.

There's also the question of whether we want to disallow team maintainers as a role, and instead just use members + OWNERS files here.  Today I can find no documented policy on who is supposed to be a Team Maintainer and what their responsibilities are.

With heapster deprecated, this is a short-term (6-9mo) solution to provide metrics/sparklines to the dashboard by scraping the Metrics API and storing a window of data. The intent is, once this is in place, to build support/integration for other metrics providers (Prometheus to start) and phase this out.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose

### Name of integration
SemaphoreCI

### Link to integration website
https://semaphoreci.com/

### Describe what is attempting to be accomplished
Essentially, we've been using SemaphoreCI for the past two years up until last November 2018. I believe when they ""upgraded"" to SemaphoreCI 2.0 they re-created their GitHub service token and thus SemaphoreCI was removed from our repo (https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose)

I would like to have SemaphoreCI Classic (not 2.0) re-enabled again so we're able to continue to do our integration tests against Kubernetes.

### Additional context for request
The use-case is to run our integration tests. At the moment we're only running unit tests and command-line tests.

### Name of integration
netlify

### Link to integration website
https://www.netlify.com/

### Describe what is attempting to be accomplished
We're attempting to set up a sub project documentation site, per SIG-docs netlify + hugo is the recommended toolset for this.

### Additional context for request
I _think_ the netlify ""site"" will have access by one member, the maintainers of kind (@munnerz and I) have created https://github.com/kind-ci-robot as a possible option to jointly manage this. If we went this route, the robot would also need to join kubernetes-sigs.

### Users effected
All approvers

### Describe the issue
Currently kubernetes_sigs is a federated set of repositories that spans multiple sigs.  Management of those subprojects is meant to be decentralized and for them to live on their own, possibly with their own lifecycle. 

As of today, there is a need to give approvers the ability to set their own milestones but they can not do that given existing permissions model on milestone maintainers.  

This is not tenable.

### Describe the issue
We're getting rolling on grooming for cp-azure and to start delegating things, I'll need admin access to that board to configure who's got access to what.

I'll be updating the Azure teams across the org at a later date and will update the permissions on this board once that happens.

### Users affected

Members of the `sig-docs-fr-*` aliases in [k/website/OWNERS_ALIASES](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES#L140-L163)

### Describe the issue

Heya! 👋 Now that docs have an active French localization, we need to add two org teams for splat reviews and mentions:
- [ ] `sig-docs-fr-owners`
- [ ] `sig-docs-fr-reviews`

Team members should match their [respective aliases](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES#L140-L163) in k/website.

### What SIG and subproject does this fall under in sigs.yaml
This is part of the Release Engineering subproject for sig-release.

### Approvals
Please prove you have followed the appropriate approval process for this new
repo by including links to the relevant approvals (meeting minutes, e-mail
thread, etc.)
See Jan 15, 2019 meeting minutes https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fu6HxXQu8wl6TwloGUEOXVzZ1rwZ72IAhglnaAMCPqA/edit

Authoritative requirements are here: https://git.k8s.io/community/github-management/kubernetes-repositories.md

tl;dr (but really you should read the linked doc, this may be stale)

This temporarily unblocks peribolos so other changes can be synced.

Note: I am only reverting the change for k-incubator here because teams in other orgs have been synced (some teams in kuberntes-incubator have also been synced but it should be ok to have that change reverted). I'm also not completely sure that this will fix the error, but it seems the best solution to me right now. I have created https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11720 to help debug better in the future.

Migrate two existing repositories of a project from `github.com/GoogleContainerTools` organization.

- https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew
- https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew-index

This is a transfer of these process to the SIG CLI as subproject as agreed upon by SIG CLI leadership.

### Requested name for new repositories

1. kubernetes-sigs/**krew**
2. kubernetes-sigs/**krew-index**

### Which Organization should it reside

kubernetes-sigs

### If not a staging repo, who should have admin access

- ahmetb
- juanvallejo
- soltysh
- seans3

### If not a staging repo, who should have write access

- team: sig-cli-maintainers
- ahmetb

### If a new repo, who should be listed as approvers in OWNERS

- ahmetb
- juanvallejo

### If a new repo, who should be listed in SECURITY_CONTACTS

- ahmetb
- juanvallejo

### What should the repo description be

- For krew: `📦 Package manager for ""kubectl plugins""`
- For krew-index: `Plugin index for https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew. This repository is intended for plugin maintainers`

### What SIG and subproject does this fall under in sigs.yaml

This is a new subproject for sig-foo called Krew.

> TODO(@ahmetb): Update sigs.yaml

### Approvals

> Please prove you have followed the appropriate approval process for this new
repo by including links to the relevant approvals (meeting minutes, e-mail
thread, etc.)

- Approval from [SIG CLI meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0YElcXt6G5mOWxwZiXgGu_X6he3F--wKwg-9UBc29I/edit#heading=h.himo1st0tqyy) from March 13, 2019:

    > Announcements: SIG-CLI will be adopting krew plugin manager. Will be adopted under the “kubernetes-sigs” repo.

- [Discussion on SIG Architecture/CLI/Apps mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-sig-cli/9fWm_aZ-AC8/RkFUFR_JBQAJ) recommending SIG CLI should make the decision

### Additional context for request

**Question about sigs.yaml:** I am not sure if sigs.yaml must be updated first or this request should be processed first.

**Question about CLAs:** We've been using Google CLA for all previous contributions to these repositories. Would this pose a problem?

**Question about copyright statements:** Currently source code license headers read ""Copyright [YYYY] Google, Inc"". Could/should this be changed or retained for a proper transfer?

**Question about third-party dependencies:** Just like any other Go project, there are some 3rd party dependencies of this project. cc'ing @caniszczyk per [this doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/github-management/kubernetes-repositories.md#sig-repositories).

**Transfer logistics** I will be coordinating transfer of repos from github.com/GoogleContainerTools side once the issue is approved. dlorenc (cc'ed below) is the owner of the source org.

### Describe the issue
While looking at https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/636, I noticed that the PR was already approved and merged, but by a non-SIG Release Chair/Lead.

I retroactively approved the PR, to make it clear that we're fine with the change, but I'd like to discuss a little. @timothysc was able to approve as he's part of Steering, which is listed as a root approver for k/org. I already chatted with Tim offline, and he said to definitely file an issue for this.

Do we want this? 
As SIGs should be responsible for organizing themselves and Steering is really supposed to be an approver/denier of last resort, I think that we should either:
- Remove Steering as a [root approver for k/org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/blob/master/OWNERS#L17).
