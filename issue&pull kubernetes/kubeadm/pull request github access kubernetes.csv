Based on @krzyzacy's feedback, we should create a basic bash script that verifies there are matching kubeadm debs for kubernetes releases.

The next steps after this are:

1. add new prow jobs to test-infra that run this script from this repo
2. add other linux distros (using `yum list` or something)

Running this on ubuntu, this is the output:

```
Skipped these versions:
 v1.5.8
These versions do not have matching debs:
 v1.6.12 v1.7.9 v1.6.10 v1.6.9 v1.6.8
```

Should we have debs for those releases?

on top of `verify_manifest_lists.go` there are some details on how this works.

QUESTION: this basically traverses manifest lists json files until it reaches the image layers.
currently download of the layers is skipped and only the `Content-Length` of their headers is verified.
these can end up being quite large, so should the full download of all layers be enabled? (the toggle is called `downloadLayers`).

test-infra PR to follow.
