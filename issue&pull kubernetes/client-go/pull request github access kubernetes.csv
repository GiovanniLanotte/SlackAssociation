- Add a CHANGELOG.md
- Remove the top-level folders for versions. Keep the contents of the 1.5 folder
- Removed the copy.sh and godeps-json-updater.go, they only need to exist in the main repository

TODO:
- Before merging this PR, we need to send out an announcement about the change kube-dev mailing list
- [DONE] We need to change the copy.sh (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/34989) and the client-go publisher robot (https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1895). Those work can be done in parallel

## WHAT

Make example codes buildable with master version.

I read https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#contributing-code and found `pkg/client` package. However, it seemed that `examples` directory did not exist there, so I made this pull request directly in this repository.

If there is another proper way to send patches, please let me know.

```
glide install --help
NAME:
   glide install - Install a project's dependencies

USAGE:
   glide install [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   This uses the native VCS of each package to install
   the appropriate version. There are two ways a project's dependencies can
   be installed. When there is a glide.yaml file defining the dependencies but
   no lock file (glide.lock) the dependencies are installed using the ""update""
   command and a glide.lock file is generated pinning all dependencies. If a
   glide.lock file is already present the dependencies are installed or updated
   from the lock file.

OPTIONS:
   --force             If there was a change in the repo or VCS switch to new one. Warning: changes will be lost.
   --strip-vendor, -v  Removes nested vendor and Godeps/_workspace directories.
   --skip-test         Resolve dependencies in test files.
```
```
glide get --help
NAME:
   glide get - Install one or more packages into `vendor/` and add dependency to glide.yaml.

USAGE:
   glide get [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   Gets one or more package (like 'go get') and then adds that file
   to the glide.yaml file. Multiple package names can be specified on one line.

       $ glide get github.com/Masterminds/cookoo/web

   The above will install the project github.com/Masterminds/cookoo and add
   the subpackage 'web'.

   If a fetched dependency has a glide.yaml file, configuration from Godep,
   GPM, GOM, or GB Glide that configuration will be used to find the dependencies
   and versions to fetch. If those are not available the dependent packages will
   be fetched as either a version specified elsewhere or the latest version.

   When adding a new dependency Glide will perform an update to work out the
   the versions for the dependencies of this dependency (transitive ones). This
   will generate an updated glide.lock file with specific locked versions to use.

   The '--strip-vendor' flag will remove any nested 'vendor' folders and
   'Godeps/_workspace' folders after an update (along with undoing any Godep
   import rewriting). Note, The Godeps specific functionality is deprecated and
   will be removed when most Godeps users have migrated to using the vendor
   folder.

OPTIONS:
   --test                   Add test dependencies.
   --insecure               Use http:// rather than https:// to retrieve packages.
   --no-recursive, --quick  Disable updating dependencies' dependencies.
   --force                  If there was a change in the repo or VCS switch to new one. Warning, changes will be lost.
   --all-dependencies       This will resolve all dependencies for all packages, not just those directly used.
   --resolve-current        Resolve dependencies for only the current system rather than all build modes.
   --strip-vendor, -v       Removes nested vendor and Godeps/_workspace directories.
   --non-interactive        Disable interactive prompts.
   --skip-test              Resolve dependencies in test files.

`glide install` just updates `glide.lock` but doesn't update /vendor.
`glide init` will detect dependencies from your current project,
making it dependent on the external files.

Just recommend users create a `glide.yaml` manually, then use
`glide update` to populate their /vendor directory. Technically you
could do a dance of `glide init` -> `glide get` -> `glide update`[0]
but this seems less error prone.

Additionally, provide instructions for users who want to use
different versions of packages than `client-go`, and add a note
about glide-vc.

Gave `dep` a shot for the first time, and due to some recently added tags to the `go-restful` package, the instructions weren't working (latest tag 2.2.0 doesn't contain go-restful/swagger package, which is required by client-go).

There might be a better way to handle this rather than pre-populating the `manifest.json`, but a couple quick cli tests didn't work (e.g. running `ensure go-restful@v1.2`).

Explanation on the diffs:
1. many .travis.yml and xxx.sh files are added to vendor. That's because copy.sh used to intentionally remove these files from k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/client-go, and the k8s.io/client-go/vendor is copied from the k8s.io/kubernetes/staging. The new scripts runs a `godep restore/save` cycle to populate the vendor/ dir, thus these .yml and .sh files are added.

2. removal of vendor/glog. This is intentional, this helps `go get` users. Details are in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/2077.
