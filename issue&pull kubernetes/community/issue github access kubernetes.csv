community,sarahnovotny,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/28,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/28,Kubernetes Elders Council - proposal,"**Problem**:  As the Kubernetes project has pivoted from a Company run open source project to a Foundation owned and community inclusive project, there have been growing pains.  The perceptions of Googler who have more structure and visibility into most of the operational aspects of the projects differ greatly from the perspectives of most of the community members - particularly new project contributors and interested project contributors.  Google intentionally chose not to have a BDFL for all the down sides that has, but a confused “power vacuum” has evolved.  The organic structure appears to a newcomer to be opaque, relationship based and full of cronyism.  There is no clear starting point progression in the project or escalation for conflict resolution etc.  Long standing (primarily Google employed) contributors feel that newcomers are all focused on specific features and aren’t stepping up to contribute to the more material and growing backlog of housekeeping, management, and organizational health tasks.

**Goals** :  Establish clear cultural, technical, and team leadership as well as act as an escalation point with a “last say” on any contentious issues.   

**Requirements**: This group should have a long standing history with the project,  good people management skills, strong technical vision for the project and empathy for the user and FOSS developer perspective.  

**Instantiation**:   The first seed incarnation of the Elders will be voted in as a slate of 3 Elders with a 2 year term (ending August 2018) through the Community Meeting and on the mailing list kubernetes-dev@.  During the first year, the Elders will add 2 members (with a term ending August 2017) to their group for a total of 5 members.

**Refreshes**:  In August each year subsequent the community will vote on the seats which term out.  All positions voted on will have a 2 year term.  The voting will be handled using Condorcet voting and a service such as [CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/).  Voter eligibility must be defined, and will require registration during a public registration period.  Nominations for candidates will be accepted for one week prior to the voting period.   

**Resignations**:  In the event that an elder resigns, the remaining elders will appoint a successor to serve until the next scheduled vote.

**Known Issues**:  Elder nomination process. Voter eligibility.

It covers the reasoning and background at a high level but I'm still pulling together the proposed design (one exists, just not in paper).

Basically, add a new ""initialization"" phase for resources that is opaque to old clients but controllers can opt in to seeing uninitialized objects - the last initializer makes the object visible to everyone else.  Also, add non-mutating generic webhooks for doing remotable checks against a server (like SubjectAccessReview). Make both of those dynamically configurable via some core API object.

community,luxas,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/142,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/142,Establish clear guidelines for who is authorized to join the organisation,"Hi,

As a Kubernetes maintainer, I've got a few people talking to me on Slack, asking what they should do in order to join the Kubernetes [organisation](https://github.com/kubernetes).

I haven't had a super-clear answer to them, and that's not great from an open community perspective.
We have to establish some clear guidelines that describes what a **contributor** should do in order to become a **member**.

(Known issues from before is also that we have no clear process for a **member** to become a **maintainer**, but with all the new OWNERS stuff that can turn a **member** in an OWNERS file to a **approver** of a PR, I think that's a lower priority item)

Definitions:
 - **Reviewer**: Anyone that have done at least one review of a PR (voluntarily)
 - **Contibutor**: Someone who has filed at least one issue and got at least one PR merged
 - **Member**: Member of the kubernetes organisation. Must be a **contributor** and a **reviewer**.
 - **Approver**: A **maintainer** or a **member** that is listed in at least one OWNERS file and have the power to `/lgtm` a PR so the Submit Queue merges it.
 - **Maintainer**: A person that works for the project's best at all times and consequently gives time to answer issues, review PRs, file issues, write PRs and organize issues/PRs by labeling and closing duplicates. Is often especially good at something, but is not working only with one small thing, instead he/she is focused on the overall health of the project. Gets flakes assigned to himself/herself.

Open question: Should a **member** have to at least be member of one SIG?


Why would someone want to be in the organisation (in no specific order)?
 - Retrigger tests on his PR
   - Actually, this should be fixed by the @kubernetes/sig-testing team. If a contributor of a PR has got the `@k8s-bot ok to test` message from someone in the org once, he/she should be able to retrigger tests in case they flake.
 - Status (have the k8s badge on his/her profile)
 - The possibility to be an assignee
 - The possibility to be an approver of a PR
 - To feel that he/she belongs to the community
 - To be able to join a sig team on Github and get sig-notifications automatically
 - etc...

We already have something here, but it doesn't explicitely address these concerns, but I think it's a good starting point.

We could define some tasks a contributor should have done before he/she can join, for example:
 - Sent more than ten pull requests (PRs) in the previous three months, or more than 40 PRs in the previous year.
 - Filed more than twelve issues in the previous three months, or more than 50 issues in the previous year.
 - Reviewed (with the review feature of Github) more than 15 pull requests in the previous three months, or more than 60 pull requests in the previous year.
 - Anything else?

I guess here we want an **OR** between the tasks above (that the contributor should have done _at least_ one of those), and the more involved the contributor are, the higher the contributor will be on the list for possible new members in the org.

We could easily program a dashboard for this in order to identify the people that are possible new members, but it could be easy to abuse that system as well (by opening nearly empty issues x times just to show up on the list), so there must always be one or more persons that then approves a person to join. The persons who allow new contributors to the organisation could be some from the **Community Elders** (#28) team.

Then we might also want some system to remove a **member** from the organisation after he/she has been inactive for a specific period of time, otherwise we'll end up with an unmanageable amount of **members**. But that's a secondary priority, we have to define the rules how to get in first.

The really hard problem with this proposal is that it's hard to draw the line, in the end of the day it's a subjective (not always objective) decision that has to be taken. But we should try to define some requirements that everyone are aware of. We don't want them to be too easy to get (we will end up with all contributors being members => unmanagable) but at the same time not too hard to get either (few members, assignees, etc. reduces the velocity of the project).

At least it would be really helpful to have a link to a document that states _something_ about this.
If someone want me to tell my story about how I became a maintainer while still attending upper secondary school in Finland and get the ""outside"" perspective from that story, feel free to ask.

P.S. I know _nothing_ about the current process. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's an inside-Google-thing right now, right?

community,smarterclayton,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/154,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/154,Proposal: Allow TerminationMessagePath to be more useful to arbitrary software,"TerminationMessagePath on containers is a mechanism to allow a container to write a useful, human or machine readable message to a file in the container that will be surfaced via the pod container status after container termination.  This data can then be displayed in a UI (to know what the result of a job or server crash was) or gathered by an API client to perform analysis on the reasons containers crash/stop/complete.

Today, it is hard for arbitrary software (images taken at random from DockerHub, general software web frameworks) to populate the termination message path, because the idea of writing to a known file on termination is a fairly unusual concept.  Like health checks, many ""normal"" applications have no mechanism to perform this function, which means the value of the platform is diminished.  In Kubernetes, we traditionally recognize this as an ""adaptation"" problem - to show value, we meet users and software where they are by providing helpful affordances to leverage the value without having to change their software.

To better realize the value of terminationMessagePath for the broad range of software, Kubernetes should:

1. Allow log output to be a candidate for the termination message
2. Allow a large class of users to benefit from log based termination messages without requiring all applications to specify they want log output directly
3. Preserve behavior for terminationMessagePath-aware applications (a client using termination message path today may expect the resulting message to *only* contain the contents of message path logs).

Because of 3, we cannot change the semantics of terminationMessagePath to include log output if the terminationMessagePath file is empty after pod termination - that would result in a behavior change.  We *could* support a new field on container that defaults to true to include logs on empty message path - that would allow a client to opt out, but may be considered a breaking change.

Proposed change:

```
type Container struct {
  ... 
  TerminationMessagePath string `json:""terminationMessagePath""`
  // NEW: UseLogsForTerminationMessage if true indicates that an empty termination message file will be populated with the recent logs from the container.
  UseLogsForTerminationMessage *bool
}
```

Users could then opt in to this behavior (and we would encourage that to happen via `kubectl run`, Helm, OpenShift templates and new-app, and docs) to populate UIs.",closed,False,2016-12-08 19:12:07,2017-08-11 16:06:57

This eliminates the required preprocessing step to convert name value pairs into configmap or secret, e.g., https://github.com/dhoer/k8s-env-gen.

From @thockin 
if there were a kubectl create configmap mode that read a file an env file and created the equivalent configmap (1 key per key), would you be satisfied?

From @fraenkel
The behavior is a bit tricky. In a simple world, I can point to a directory of env files and say kubectl create configmap --from-file somedir. Duplicates are where things become tricky. What order are we processing the files in the directory? Are we sorting them? Or letting the filesystem hand them in some random order?
I will also assume you can provide multiple directories to allow overrides.

From many
For directory, I would assume whatever order it reads today, where on duplicated keys, the last one wins. They can use multiple --from-file entries to get the order they want. Subsequent --from-file entries are will overwrite any repeating key values.

From @thockin 
I was thinking --from-env-file=filename and only allowing one, and not a directory.

From @kad
If we already touching this part of API spec, it might be good also to add one thing: referenced ConfigMap might be optional. By default this option will be false, so if ConfigMap referenced and it is missing, it will lead to error. If optional parameter set to true, and referenced ConfigMap not found, it will continue normally. Use case for such behavior:

- Application developer can prepare Application deployment with referencing ConfigMap with default values. Developer also can reference optional ConfigMap with parameters that can be overridden in e.g. testing cluster, or regional cluster. If those overrides not found or not used, application will get all the rest of default values from ConfigMap of defaults, shipped with Deployment spec.
- Same deployment in public and private cloud: *_proxy variables.. Developer can write spec that will be referencing ConfigMap with some agreed name, e.g. ""cluster-proxies"". In case of deployment of this application in private cluster this ConfigMap would contain http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy and other variables specific to this cluster. Same deployment sent to cluster in public cloud with direct internet access will be referencing non-existing optional ConfigMap, so containers will be run without pre-populated proxy variables.

From @thockin 
We may yet end up with ""if present"" configmap volumes - it would actually
simplify a whole swath of scenarios.  But we should do that and this in
tandem.

From @fraenkel

community,bowei,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/172,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/172,Proposal: Move kubedns addon code to its own repository under Kubernetes,"# Overview
The kube-dns pod currently consists of the `kube-dns` daemon, `dnsmasq` and their healthcheck sidecars (`exec-healthz` and `dnsmasq-metrics`). The code is spread over both main `kubernetes/` and `contrib/` repositories. Images for each of the containers are currently versioned separately. For example, the `kube-dns` that ships with Kubernetes v1.5 is v1.9, `dnsmasq-metrics` v1.0 etc. 

Note: exec-healthz is being removed from the pod shortly.

It would be more coherent to move all of the related code into the same respository. `kube-dns` consumes only public APIs and the release of all Kubernetes maintained code can be unified.

# Plan of action 
* Create a new repository in kubernetes called `dns`
* Copy code (keeping history) of `kubernetes/pkg/dns` to `dns/pkg/dns`
* Copy code (keeping history) of `kubernetes/cmd/kube-dns` to `dns/cmd/kube-dns`
* Copy code (keeping history) of `contrib/dnsmasq-metrics` to `dns/cmd/kube-dns-sidecar`, adjusting `pkg` and `cmd` appropriately
* Copy code (keeping history) `contrib/dnsmasq` to `dns/dnsmasq`
* Use the [standard build template](https://github.com/thockin/go-build-template) for the verification and build infrastructure
* e2e testing of DNS will remain in the Kubernetes repo. I would defer any potential movement of e2e tests until the [separation of e2e from the main repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36624) has been concretized.
* `kubernetes/cluster/addons` will remain for now.
* Add hook to run e2e against current kube-dns build. Note: this is not done today in the kubernetes repo itself.

# Impacts
* Kubernetes cluster/addon will refer to externally built image. This is already the case, as the CI system does not pick up changes to the kube-dns code. The referenced image on gcr.io is used instead.
* kube-dns is a leaf project, output of `git grep 'k8s.io/kubernetes/\(cmd\|pkg\)/dns/' | grep -v '^\(pkg/dns\|cmd/kube-dns\)'` shows only one e2e test as an external dependency which will be removed.",closed,False,2016-12-13 19:05:05,2016-12-15 21:23:40

community,mengqiy,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/187,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/187,"Proposal: Use Selector Generation for Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet and ReplicationController","Selector Generation for Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet and ReplicationController
=============

# Goals
Make selector easy to use and less error-prone for Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet and ReplicationController. Make `kubectl apply` work with selector.

# Problem Description
The field `spec.selector` of Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet are default to `spec.template.metadata.labels`, if it is unspecified.
And there is validation to make sure `spec.selector` always selects the pod template.
The defaulting of selector may prevent from `kubectl apply` from working when updating the `spec.selector` field.

# Example
Here is an example from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/26202#issuecomment-221421254 showing how defaulting selector prevents `kubectl apply` from working.
First create a Deployment via `kubectl apply`
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
        test: abcd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Then remove any of the labels in the file (and optionally specify the selector), and then `kubectl apply`.
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Error message is like
```
The Deployment ""nginx-deployment"" is invalid: spec.template.metadata.labels: Invalid value: {""app"":""nginx""}: `selector` does not match template `labels`
```
`kubectl apply` won't suffer this issue, if selector generation is also used for Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet and ReplicationController.

# Proposed changes

The [Selector Generation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/selector-generation.md) works well in Job. Use this pattern for Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet and ReplicationController.
If `spec.selector` is not derived from `spec.template.metadata.labels`, `kubectl apply` will works well for selectors.

## API

The change will be the same as [the changes to Job](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/selector-generation.md#api).
And the changes will be applied to Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet and ReplicationController.
Deployments, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, StatefulSet are in `extensions/v1beta1`.
ReplicationController is in `core/v1`.

## kubectl

No required changes.

## Version skew

1) old client vs new APIserver: old client don't know field `spec.manualSelector`, it will be considered as nil value at server-side and the server will auto-generate selector. 

2) new client vs old APIserver: `spec.manualSelector` will be ignored, since the APIServer don't understand this field. It should behave as before.

community,kargakis,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/194,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/194,Proposal: Introduce Available Pods (MinReadySeconds in the PodSpec),"## Moved to https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/478

Today, Deployments/ReplicaSets use MinReadySeconds in order to include an additional delay on top of readiness checks and facilitate more robust rollouts. The ReplicaSet controller decides how many available Pods a ReplicaSet runs and the Deployment controller, when rolling out new Pods, will not proceed if the minimum available Pods that are required to run are not ready for at least MinReadySeconds (if MinReadySeconds is not specified then the Pods are considered available as soon as they are ready).

Two problems that have been identified so far with the current state of things:
1. A Pod is marked ready by the kubelet as soon as it passes its readiness check. The ReplicaSet controller runs as part of master and estimates when a Pod is available by comparing the time the Pod became ready (as seen by the kubelet) with MinReadySeconds. [Clock-skew between master and nodes will affect the availability checks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/29229). 
2. PodDisruptionBudget is working with ready Pods and has no notion of MinReadySeconds when used by a Deployment/ReplicaSet. 

Both problems above can be solved by moving MinReadySeconds in the PodSpec. Once kubelet observes that a Pod has been ready for at least MinReadySeconds without any of its containers crashing, it will update the PodStatus with an Available condition set to Status=True. Higher-level orchestrators running on different machines such as the ReplicaSet or the PodDisruptionBudget controller will merely need to look at the Available condition that is set in the status of a Pod.

## API changes

A new field is proposed in the PodSpec:
```go
	// Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready
	// without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available.
	// Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)
	// +optional
	MinReadySeconds *int32 `json:""minReadySeconds,omitempty""`
```
and a new PodConditionType:
```go
	// PodAvailable is added in a ready pod that has MinReadySeconds specified. The pod
	// should already be added under a load balancer and serve requests, this condition
	// lets higher-level orchestrators know that the pod is running after MinReadySeconds
	// without having any of its containers crashed.
	PodAvailable PodConditionType = ""Available""
```
Additionally:
* Deployments/ReplicaSets/DaemonSets already use MinReadySeconds in their spec so we should probably deprecate those fields in favor of the field in the PodSpec and remove them in a future version. 
* Deployments/ReplicaSets will not propagate MinReadySeconds from their Spec down to the pod template because that will lead in differences in the pod templates between a Deployment and a ReplicaSet resulting in new rollouts. If MinReadySeconds is specified both in the spec and pod template for a Deployment/ReplicaSet and it's not the same value, a validation error will be returned (tentative). API defaulting can set MinReadySeconds in the spec, if it's specified only in the PodTemplate (tentative).
* ReplicaSets that specify MinReadySeconds only in the ReplicaSetSpec, can create new Pods by specifying MinReadySeconds in their PodSpec (w/o updating the ReplicaSet pod template).

## kubelet changes
For a Pod tha specifies MinReadySeconds, kubelet will need to check (after MinReadySeconds) if any of the Pod containers has crashed. If not, it will switch the Available condition to Status=True in the status of the Pod. Pods that don't specify MinReadySeconds, won't have the Available condition set in their status.

## Controller manager changes
The ReplicaSet controller will create new Pods by setting MinReadySeconds in their PodSpec if it's specified in the ReplicaSetSpec (and not in the ReplicaSet pod template). For Pods that don't specify MinReadySeconds, it can switch to use a virtual clock and continue using the current approach of estimating availability. This will also help in keeping new servers backwards-compatible with old kubelets.

## Future work
The PDB controller will need to be extended to recognize the Available condition in Pods. It may also need to get into the bussiness of estimating availability for Deployments/ReplicaSets that already use MinReadySeconds (already existing Pods are not going to be updated with an Available condition - see the section above about kubelet changes).

community,mengqiy,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/229,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/229,Proposal: Add Discriminators in All Unions/OneOf APIs,"# Overview

We have a number of cases in the API where only one of a set of fields is allowed to be specified, aka undiscriminated union / oneof.

`VolumeSource` is the canonical example: it has fields such as emptyDir, gcePersistentDisk, awsElasticBlockStore and other 20 fields. Only one of these fields can be specified.

We should add discriminators to union / oneof APIs, since it has several advantages.

Original issue is described in kubernetes/kubernetes#35345

# Advantages

Adding discriminators to all unions/oneof cases would have multiple advantages:

1. Clients could effectively implement a switch instead of if-else trees to inspect the resource -- look at discriminator and lookup the corresponding field in a map (though differences in capitalization of the first letter in the API convention currently prevents the discriminator value from exactly matching the field name).

2. The API server could automatically clear non-selected fields, which would be convenient for `kubectl apply` and other cases.

# Analysis

## List of Impacted APIs
In `pkg/api/v1/types.go`:
- [`VolumeSource`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/api/v1/types.go#L232)
- [`PersistentVolumeSource`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/api/v1/types.go#L340)
- [`Handler`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/api/v1/types.go#L1467)
- [`ContainerState`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/api/v1/types.go#L1558)
- [`PodSignature`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/api/v1/types.go#L2933): It has only one field, but the comment says ""Exactly one field should be set"". Maybe we will add more in the future?

In `pkg/authorization/types.go`:
- [`SubjectAccessReviewSpec`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/apis/authorization/types.go#L108)Exactly one of ResourceAttributes and NonResourceAttributes must be set. But other non-union fields also exist in this API.
- [`SelfSubjectAccessReviewSpec`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/apis/authorization/types.go#L130)

In  `pkg/apis/extensions/v1beta1/types.go`:
- [`DeploymentStrategy`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/apis/extensions/types.go#L251)
- [`NetworkPolicyPeer`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/apis/extensions/v1beta1/types.go#L1338)
- [`IngressRuleValue`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-alpha.0/pkg/apis/extensions/v1beta1/types.go#L874): It says ""exactly one of the following must be set"". But it has only one field.

## Behavior

If the discriminator were set, we'd require that the field corresponding to its value were set and the APIServer (registry) could automatically clear the other fields. 

If the discriminator were unset, behavior would be as before -- exactly one of the fields in the union/oneof would be required to be set and the operation would otherwise fail validation.

We should set discriminators by default. This means we need to change it accordingly when the corresponding union/oneof fields were set and unset. If so, clients can rely on this for purpose (1).

# Proposed Changes

## API
Add a discriminator field in all unions/oneof APIs.

The discriminator should be optional for backward compatibility. There is an example below, the field `Type` works as a discriminator.
```go
type PersistentVolumeSource struct {
	// +optional
	GCEPersistentDisk *GCEPersistentDiskVolumeSource `json:""gcePersistentDisk,omitempty"" protobuf:""bytes,1,opt,name=gcePersistentDisk""`
	// +optional
	AWSElasticBlockStore *AWSElasticBlockStoreVolumeSource `json:""awsElasticBlockStore,omitempty"" protobuf:""bytes,2,opt,name=awsElasticBlockStore""`
	
...

	// Discriminator for PersistentVolumeSource, it can be ""gcePersistentDisk"", ""awsElasticBlockStore"" and etc.
	// +optional
	Type *string `json:""type,omitempty"" protobuf:""bytes,24,opt,name=type""`
}
```

## API Server

We need to add defaulting logic described in the [Behavior](#behavior) section.

## kubectl

No change required on kubectl.

# Example Discriminators

## Discriminator are Set by Default
Assume we have added a field as discussed in section [API changes](#api)

We first use `kubectl apply -f` create a `PersistentVolume` using the following config:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: ""slow""
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  hostPath:
    path: /tmp
```

The subsequent `kubectl get` should have the discriminator field set by API server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: slow
  creationTimestamp: 2016-12-22T00:56:31Z
  name: pv0001
  namespace: """"
  resourceVersion: ""1059564""
  selfLink: /api/v1/persistentvolumespv0001
  uid: 7a57e42b-c7e1-11e6-aa89-42010a800002
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  hostPath:
    path: /tmp
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  # Discriminator showing the type is ""hostPath""
  type: hostPath
status:
  phase: Available
```

## Automatically Clear Unselected Fields
Issue kubernetes/kubernetes#34292 will be fixed if `spec.strategy.type` is treated as a discriminator.

Create a deployment using `kubectl apply-f`

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Get the deployment back. Fields `spec.strategy.type` and `spec.strategy.rollingUpdate` have been defaulted.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: ""1""
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {""kind"":""Deployment"",""apiVersion"":""extensions/v1beta1"",""metadata"":{""name"":""nginx-deployment"",""creationTimestamp"":null},""spec"":{""replicas"":1,""template"":{""metadata"":{""creationTimestamp"":null,""labels"":{""app"":""nginx""}},""spec"":{""containers"":[{""name"":""nginx"",""image"":""nginx"",""ports"":[{""containerPort"":80}],""resources"":{}}]}},""strategy"":{}},""status"":{}}
  creationTimestamp: 2016-12-22T01:23:34Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: ""1062013""
  selfLink: /apis/extensions/v1beta1/namespaces/default/deployments/nginx-deployment
  uid: 416ef165-c7e5-11e6-aa89-42010a800002
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  strategy:
    # Defaulted by API server
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    # Defaulted by API server
    type: RollingUpdate
...
```

Then we update the config file by adding

```yaml
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
```

Apply the new config by `kubectl apply -f`.

The operation should succeed now, because now the API server knows to clear field `spec.strategy.rollingUpdate` after updating `spec.strategy.type`.

community,countspongebob,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/295,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/295,Three Branches of Governance - Proposal,"The long term health of any open source project depends on the people that contribute. Just as importantly, those people need a framework for working together effectively. Kubernetes continues to enjoy rapid growth and adoption and has been transitioning rapidly from an exciting new project to one with large numbers of productions systems, many at scale.

One of the very important balances between forces our project must navigate is the balance between speed of innovation and feature evolution and the needs of the production users for boring, dependable infrastructure.

As the project has grown in usage, it has also grown in contributors. The more informal practices that suited our project in the early days are proving unsuitable, in part because those informal practices have been strongly based on personal relationships between the early contributors. Those practices and norms are opaque to new contributors and had become a barrier to attracting new contributors and ensuring they can be productive members of the community.

As production deployments of Kubernetes have expanded, the need for longer range planning by those users has become more urgent. As Kubernetes becomes more central to the infrastructure of any company, the need for roadmaps, goals, and planning transparency have also become more central.

This has led to one very significant (currently in place) change to the Kubernetes Way (PM group), and another major one is proposed - the Council of Elders. **I propose that a third is needed.**

A significant event in the Kubernetes community was the formation of the Product Management Group. The value of this group to aid in future planning, roadmaps, and in the feature-level planning of the project is undeniable.

Teams that tilt the power structures towards engineering teams tend to build great architectures, but struggle with user experience and to build features users really want. Teams that tilt the power structures towards product management are often feature-rich with stove-piped architectures that struggle to scale and meet their SLOs. One of the biggest challenges leaders have is balancing these views. The Kubernetes project has this same challenge.

Introduction of the Council of Elders is not just a positive step for the project but an utter necessity, and I support creation immediately. Critically, though, this Council must have wide enough representation and diversity, and sufficiently engaged members to directly guide and influence the main technical and architectural issues of the project. I echo the sentiments of many in the community: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/28

Today, the Product Management Group has also become the de facto process management and project policy owner for the project.  Just as with features vs architecture tradeoffs, project policies have to balance the needs and desires of the product management view of the project with the developer view, and manage the tradeoffs between predictability, reporting, agility, and productivity. The speed of change of processes can have a profound effect on project productivity - both positive and negative - and are not best managed from the product management view alone.

Project policies play a key role in how these tradeoffs are discussed, and how decisions are made and communicated. _These policies are not meant to make those tradeoffs_, but to ensure that balanced, judged, and rational decisions are made in a transparent way, that the policies of the project are documented, communicated and followed.

I propose model that has a track record of success....**Three groups with clear separation of empowerment and responsibilities:**

- Product Management Group (Features, Roadmaps, Releases, Documentation)
- Council of Elders (Architecture, Design, Owner of Technical Standards)
- Project Policy Board (Processes, SIGs, Transparency, Traceability, and Legal/Licensing)

For the separation-of-powers model to work well it is especially important that these three groups have non-overlapping members. 

_Project policies should be treated with equal respect and care to features and architecture_, especially in a large open source project, where coordinating large groups of people from many companies is such a challenge.

This third empowered group in combination will help Kubernetes succeed over the long run.

I ask for your support in the community for this proposal.

Proposal:

* `kubernetes.io/`, and `*.kubernetes.io` (collectively called top-level names) are managed centrally and should be considered reserved.  We will document and manage them centrally.

* `*.alpha.kubernetes.io`, and `*.beta.kubernetes.io` are reserved for alpha/beta of centrally managed names.

* `*.<repo>.x.kubernetes.io` is reserved for use in that component / repo (NB, repo moves will cause pain).

* As a component becomes more popular, it may petition for a top-level (non-x) name.

* All existing names will be grandfathered and not forced to change, though owners are encouraged to accept and document the ""new"" names.

The only comment I did not address is: ""Cumulative cpu usage needs to be accompanied with time window from which it was collected.""
It may make sense to add the start time to the endpoint.  This would give the full time window as the ""end time"" is the timestamp.
I plan to omit the start time for now, as it isnt really a ""metric"", since it is constant.
Other than computing the long-term average cpu usage, I also dont see a use for the start time.  Comparing two sequential sets of metrics would produce a short term usage rate over the time period between the two metrics.  @vishh had expressed a desire to include this short-term rate in addition to the long term total in the endpoint as well.
Regardless, I think this is something that should be addressed when we decide on the format of the endpoint.  The set of metrics as laid out in the proposal should cover this case.

community,pmorie,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/350,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/350,Improve documentation about community norms and processes ,"The [incubator process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/incubator.md) is currently very light on details about a number of facets of the community.  As an example, the role of the Champion is defined as:

> Potential Champions come from the set of all Kubernetes approvers and reviewers with the hope that they will be able to teach the Incubator Project about Kubernetes community norms and processes. The Champion is the primary point of contact for the Incubator Project team; and will help guide the team through the process. The majority of the mentorship, review, and advice will come from the Champion. Being a Champion is a significant amount of work and active participation in the sponsored project is encouraged.

The 'community norms and processes' referred to are very sparsely defined.

Since we are attempting to control growth and sprawl in `kubernetes/kubernetes`, it is logical to assume that in the future many people will make their entrance into the development part of our community via the incubator process.  We should ensure that newcomers have a way to understand the community norms and processes in a way that:

1.  Doesn't depend on the personal knowledge level of an incubator repo Champion
2.  Doesn't depend on the personal bandwidth of an incubator repo Champion
3.  Is accurate, high-fidelity, and maintained by the community

Our experience from SIG service catalog has been that:

1.  Newcomers to the community who make contact first with an incubator do not have an easy way to familiarize themselves with the community norms and processes
2.  Because the norms and processes knowledge exists across the minds of many different individuals and has been transmitted via oral history, few people fully know what the established norms and processes are
3.  Knowledge transmission via retelling and answering individual questions is extremely inefficient and time consuming
4.  Motivation and rationale behind norms are not always clear to people who are familiar with the norms and processes

I think it would improve things if we:

1.  Clearly define the most important norms and process that should be followed; there are probably different ones that become important at different levels of maturity
2.  Clearly define which norms and processes must be adopted as exit criteria to incubation
3.  Document each norm and process from the above clearly, with onboarding instructions for things that require setup (bots, CI, etc)

Specific norms and processes from our experience in SIG service catalog:

1.  Code review / approval process:
    1.  Whose approval is needed for a particular change?
    2.  Pointers to automation for reviews and approvals
2.  Overall approach to generated code:
    1.  What code is generated?
    2.  Which generated code is commited to source control?
3.  Dependency management and vendoring code:
    1.  Which dependency management tool should be used?
    2.  Are dependencies vendored?
4.  Overall system architecture patterns:
    1.  What is the lifecycle of an API request?
    2.  How does one construct an API server?
    3.  How does one create a new controller?
5.  Testing
	1.  What level of testing is expected/required?
	2.  What dependencies can a repository require for testing? Viz: must an incubator repo be testable on a laptop without an internet connection?  With an internet connection?

Though this issue has already mentioned the following, I want to note again for emphasis that in addition to the facts for these, it is also critical to document the rationale behind the facts.

Specific asks for this issue:

1.  Let's add some specificity about the areas I've cited that we had some trouble with in the service catalog SIG
    1.  Note: it's totally possible that we won't wind up wanting to be prescriptive in certain areas -- we should be explicit about those too
2.  Let's try to have (1) done by the time 1.6 is released",closed,False,2017-02-09 16:47:44,2018-03-13 00:35:34
community,sebgoa,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/351,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/351,Kubernetes Bylaws,"I have been meaning to write some comments related to:

#28 #295 and #286 

Specifically, I think that the Kubernetes projects needs ""Bylaws"". The Bylaws can encompass most of what is in the Governance being worked on, the Elders proposal and the Three branches.

As a member of the [ASF](https://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html) and member of the Kubernetes project, I think that a middle ground can be found between clear Bylaws that show how the project is organized and governed and simple ways to take decisions without too much bureaucracy.

Couple general comments:

---
The Kubernetes Way in the Governance document is very close to the Apache Way. One item that is not there is the concept of ""non affiliation"". This means that people talk on behalf of themselves and do not represent corporate interest. Non-affiliation is useful to avoid perception that a project is *not* governed by companies. This helps build a true sense of community, where people's involvement is measured on merit.

---
Right now the community is fragmented between the mailing lists, the SIG, SLACK, stack overflow etc. Apache puts the emphasis on mailing lists. What happens on the mailing list is what happens in the community, it is where the community lives. It is where decisions are taken. Any meeting reports to the mailing lists for archiving, and further discussion from members who could not attend meetings. The emphasis is put on consensus.

A purely consensus driven project is arguably difficult to operate. I believe that we can find a good balance of consensus and benevolent dictator model.

As an Apache guy, I find kubernetes-dev surprisingly very low volume. And often decision or important discussions are happening out of band. It does not promote inclusion.

Github is not a great way to promote inclusion or bring attention to important proposals. If you are not tagged in an issue/PR you don't know what is happening. DISCUSS threads should be created on the proper mailing lists of each project/sub-project/incubator. If consensus is not reached then our technical leaders will break the ties.

---
Taking an approach that mimics the Apache structure we could organize the project with:

* A Board (The Kubernetes board, similar to what is described in the Elders proposal)

* The Members ( Could be the current set of Github Members)

* The Committers ( Folks with write access to some repos in the kubernetes and kubernetes-incubator orgs)

* The Contributors (Anyone involved in the project but without commit access yet).

* The Incubator ( Set of projects in the kubernetes-incubator)

---

Basic working mechanisms would be:

* The Board is elected once a year by the members (could be initialized by the current root OWNERS in kubernetes/kubernetes )
* The members nominate new members once a year. new members get in via vote.
* Create ""Project committees"" per repo (e.g Helm Project committee). With a ""Vice President"" which report status to the Board. The PC of a repo is made of committers to that repo (could be mapped to Github sub team for initialization).
* The set of committers is made of the committers of all project committees. (not all would be members).
* ""Promotion"" is based on merit and committers get voted in after nomination from exiting PC members.
* The Incubator needs to be properly created with its own PC and Chair. Graduation needs to be a vote in the Incubator main mailing lists.
* Each project has a project-dev@ mailing list (we currently kind of have that, just needs to be cleaned up).

---

Once we have these basic mechanisms in place ( in the form of short/succint bylaws), agreed on by VOTE on kubernetes-dev, we can move towards implementing a clear leadership structure as highlighted in the ""three branches"" (which BTW would start differentiating with Apache).

We need it because we need to compare DaemonSet template with DaemonSet pods to know if the pods need to be updated, and:

1. Pod template hash isn't 100% reliable - it may change on PodTemplate API changes (e.g. adding new fields), and users will encounter unexpected DeamonSet rolling update after upgrading Kubernetes to a different version. 
2. It's not easy to infer pod template from a pod's spec, since many default values are applied to the pod, and the admission controller may update the pod as well. 

@erictune @lavalamp @kargakis @lukaszo @smarterclayton @kubernetes/sig-apps-api-reviews @kow3ns @foxish @enisoc @pwittrock 

--- 
Copied from my comment in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41116#issuecomment-279817775:

1. In DaemonSet update strategy, PodTemplateGeneration++ on DS.spec.template updates
2. When DS creates pods, label them with current PodTemplateGeneration (""pod-template-generation=n"")
    - Use labels since it's easy for the controller and the users to filter pods that match current podtemplate generation.
3. DS compares pods' ""pod-template-generation"" label against its own PodTemplateGeneration to decide to kill (update) this pod or not.

One drawback is that it's not extensible (customized controllers that extend DaemonSet controller will have to modify API server code as well) - we decided not to worry about this for now. 

Another drawback is that in the rollback case (in the future), we may restart more pods than we want (since we can only roll forward PodTemplateGeneration), and pods gen 1 may actually be the same as DS gen 3. 

We can solve the rollback case with DaemonSet history + pod template hash. We use history objects (maybe stand-alone PodTemplate objects?) to store pod-template-hash and templates, and we compare pods' pod-template-hash labels with history and compare history template with DaemonSet template. 

**Alternatives:** 
1. I thought about using `json.Marshal` before hashing the object so that new fields with `omitempty` wouldn't change the hash value. However, if a new field was added to PodTemplate with some default value, the hash will still change. 
2. White-listing fields we care about when hashing pod template... this is not extensible. 
3. Implement a helper function that gives you podtemplate given a pod spec. This is hard to implement, as many default values will be added to a pod, and admission controller will also update the pod.",closed,True,2017-02-15 00:21:23,2017-02-23 21:19:00

community,dashpole,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/380,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/380,[Proposal] Eviction Soft is Relative to Hard Eviction Threshold(s),"The purpose of soft evictions, as I understand them, is to allow for pods to burst for short periods of time without evicting them.

In the current state of things, we have the ""eviction-hard"" threshold, and the ""eviction-soft"" threshold.  However, once we implement #348, we essentially have two ""hard eviction"" thresholds.

Consider the following scenario (excluding this change, but including #348):
--eviction-hard=memory.available<10%
--eviction-soft=memory.available<15%
--kube-reserved=cpu=100m, memory=100Mi
--system-reserved=cpu=100m, memory=100Mi
Node Capacity = cpu: 1000m, memory=1000Mi

Doing the math, we get:
eviction-hard=cpu<900m, memory<900Mi
eviction-soft=cpu<850m, memory<850Mi
allocatable=cpu (of only pods) <700m, memory (of only pods) <700m

If system usage is cpu=100m, memory=100Mi, then we will hit the ""hard"" allocatable threshold before the ""soft"" eviction-soft threshold.
Since the purpose of soft evictions is to **not** immediately evict them, but allow them to burst, this is not ideal.

I see two possible solutions:
1.  Add a separate allocatable-soft flag for soft evictions before hitting allocatable thresholds
2. Convert eviction-soft to be relative to hard eviction thresholds, and in the future, use this value as a soft threshold for both eviction-hard, and allocatable limits.

This proposal covers option 2.

Question is, Kubernetes pods from one Cluster (VPC) can not ping Pod in another cluster through it's internal IP. I see traffic leaving pod and minion but dont see it on other VPC.

Here is IP info:

Cluster 1 (VPC 1) - subnet 172.21.0.0/16

One thing that is clear is that people are trying to solve different problems. The purpose of this issue is to surface those problems and (ideally) to come to agreement about which problems we're going to tackle first. Then we get move onto proposals for how we're going to solve them.

Some problems that have been mentioned, culled from the above, in no particular order:

* The structure of the project is opaque to newcomers. 
* There is no clear technical escalation path / procedure.
* There aren't consistent / official decision-making procedures for ~anything: consensus, lazy consensus, consensus-seeking, CIVS voting, etc.
* There are no official processes for adding org members, reviewers, approvers, maintainers, project leaders, etc.
* There is no official / regularly meeting body to drive overall technical vision of the project.
* We don't agree on the right level/types of engagement for leaders. Some feel that leaders should be recused from responsibilities such as SIG leadership, while others feel they need to be deeply involved in releases, etc.
* There aren't official technical leads for most subareas of the project.
* There is no centralized / authoritative means of resolving non-technical problems on the project, including staffing gaps (engineering, docs, test, release, ...), effort gaps (tragedy of the commons), expertise mismatches, priority conflicts, personnel conflicts, etc.
* In particular, there is insufficient effort on contributor experience (e.g., github tooling, project metrics), code organization and build processes, documentation, test infrastructure, and test health. Some on the project have argued that there is insufficient backpressure and/or incentives for people employed to deliver customer-facing features to spend time on issues important to overall project health.
* A related issue is counterbalancing technical- and product-based decision-making.
* Visibility across the entire project is lacking.
* Metrics, metrics, metrics, metrics. We're flying blind.
* There is no documented proposal process.
* There isn't a documented process for advancing APIs through alpha, beta, stable stages of development.
* Project technical leaders (de facto or otherwise) are not available via office hours.
* We don't have processes or documentation for onboarding new contributors.
* There are no official safeguards to prevent control over the project by a single company.
* Project leadership lacks diversity.
* There is no conflict of interest policy regarding leading/directing both the open-source project and commercialization efforts around the project.
* There is no consistent, documented process for rolling out new processes and major project changes (e.g., requiring two-factor auth, adding the approvers mechanism, moving code between repositories).
* Nobody has taken responsibility to think about and improve the structure of the project, processes, values, etc. A few people have been working on this part time, but it needs more and more consistent attention given the rate of growth of the project. 
* We're also lacking people to drive, implement, communicate, and roll out improvements (and test, measure, rollback, etc.).
* There isn't a sufficiently strong feedback loop between technical contributors/leadership and the PM group.
* Nobody has taken responsibility for legal issues, license validation, trademark enforcement, etc.
* Technical conventions/principles are not sufficiently documented.
* Development practices and conventions across our repositories are not consistent.
* Our communication media are highly fragmented, which makes it hard to understand past decisions.

What other problems do people think we need to solve? Let's brainstorm first, then prioritize and cull.

Customer likes AWS ELBs but they need the ELBs to have [custom AWS resource tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) so that their internal billback system doesn't delete ELBs created by Kubernetes that don't have a customer specific team tag. The Kubernetes AWS tagging feature [currently offered isn't flexible enough](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/aws_under_the_hood.md#tagging).

## Proposal

Create a new AWS specific annotation for services which will list the additional tags that should be applied to an AWS ELB Resource. Any labels which overlap with those used internally by the AWS Cloud Provider would be ignored. An example annotation would have the form

```
aws.kubernetes.io/additional-resource-tags=""Owner=AwesomeTeam,Project=Testing""
```

and would create tags at the same time all other tags are created by the cloud provider. In the future it may make sense to add the ability to specify additional labels [in the cloud provider configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/aws/aws.go#L385) in order to allow all provisioning tools to apply labels to resources besides ELBs.

community,tamalsaha,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/424,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/424,Proposal: Implement stateful TPR Flock,"_[Birds of a feather flock together](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Birds%20of%20a%20feather%20flock%20together)_

When we run stateful apps (apps that store data in disk) like GlusterFS or various databases, we face a choice which Kubernetes object to use for provisioning such objects. Here are the requirements:

- Stable routable network ID (stable across restarts). Must support reverse PTR records.
- Must be safe to run applications without authentication using the stable network ID
- Run multiple replica with persistent storage.
- It should be possible to run the different replicas on different nodes to achieve high availability. _(Optional)_

This can't be achieved in cloud providers that do not have native support for persistent storage or Kubernetes does not have volume controller (eg, DigitialOcean, Linode, etc).

Here is my proposal on how to meet the above requirements in a cloud provider agnostic way.

**StatefulSet**: If the underlying cloud provider have native support cloud disk and has built-in support in  Kubernetes (aws/gce/azure), then we can use StatefulSet. We can prevision disks manually and bind them with claims. We might be able to also provision them using dynamic provisioning. Moreover, StatefulSets will allow using pod name as a stable network ID. Users can also use pod placement options to ensure that pods are distributed across nodes. This allows for HA.

**DaemonSet**: Cloud providers that does not support built-in storage and/or has no native support in Kubernetes (eg, DigitalOcean, Linode) can't use StatefulSets to run stateful apps. Stateful apps running in these clusters must use hostpath to store data or risk losing it when pods restart. StatefulSet can't dynamically provision host path bound PVCs. In these cases, we could use DaemonSet. We have to use `hostpath` or emptyDir` type PV with the DaemonSet. If DaemonSets are run with pod network, no stable ID is possible. If DaemonSets run with host network, then they might use node IP. Node names are generally not routable. But Node IPs are not stable either, since most times these are allocated via DHCP. Also, for cloud providers like DigitalOcean, host network are also shared and not safe to run with out authentication.

Luckily, we can achieve something similar to StatefulSet in such providers. The underlying process is based on how named headless services work as described here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/dns/ .

In these types of providers, we have to run N ReplicaSet with replica=1. We can use a fixed hostpath. We can chose N nodes and index then from 0..n-1. We apply a nodeSelector with these RCs to ensure rc with index _i_ always runs on node with index _i_. Since they are on separate node, they can safely use same host path. For network ID, we set both `hostname` and `sub-domain` in the PodTemplate for these RCs. This will give the pods a dns name the same was StatefulSets pods get. Since these pods are using pod network, it should be safe to run applications without authentication. Now, we have N pods with stable name and running on different nodes using hostpath. Voila! 

To simplify the full process, we can create a new TPR called Flock. We implement GlusterFS or kube databases using this TPR. The Flock controller will be in charge of translating this into the appropriate Kubernetes object based on flags set on the controller.

Is there a simpler way to achieve this?",closed,False,2017-03-02 15:55:59,2017-03-02 18:24:24

community,boynux,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/429,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/429,Proposal: IPvS implementation for KubeProxy,"# Overview:

The current proxy with IPTables implementation has some limitations.

* The most problematic one is inability to pass-through the original request IP address. 
* The other issue is load distribution algorithms over the origins.

Many applications rely on request source address information to work normally. Most layer 7 proxies like NginX or HAProxy can add ""X-Forwarded-For"" header to the original request. The issue is it mostly works with HTTP requests but not all TCP and UDP requests.
On the other hand at the moment there is no way to define how the traffic should be distributed across the origins (it relies on iptables round-robin)

# Motivation

[IPvS or LVS](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org) is a kernel module that can provide various forms of layer 3 loadbalancing without relying on iptables. Two main reasons to use LVS are:

* [Direct Routing](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/VS-DRouting.html), can preserve the request IP header information (via Virtual IPs) 
* We can use different [routing algorithms](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/docs/scheduling.html) Like least connection or weighted routing

# Limitations

Although other routing models like LVS/NAT support port mappings but LVS/DR does not. Which means services will not be able to map their ports to different Pod ports if DR mode is enabled.

# Related works:

Currently Docker Swarm using the method

# Design

## Kube Proxy

* Operates in this new modes LVS/NAT or LVS/DR.
* Adds new origins and remove obsolete ones from IPvS kernel module (LinuxDirector).
* Injects virtaul IPs into Pods if it operates in DR mode.
* Enable IPvS NAT in iptables if operates in NAT mode (using xt_ipvs)

## Pods

* If KubeProxy operates in DR mode pods need to use the assigned Virtual IP to communicate to the client.

There are more than 30 Kubernetes distributions and services today. The portability of applications and tools across distributions is crucial to the health of the Kubernetes ecosystem. It is therefore desirable to foster maximal portability and to discourage fragmentation.

At least one component of such a strategy could be a certification program that would need to be followed in order to use the Kubernetes trademark. We may also want to reinforce other desirable behaviors, such as:

* Use of the Kubernetes trademark -- ""Kubernetes outside""
* Upstream patches to fix security issues and other bugs
* Share plug-ins and other extensions
* Usage reporting -- [Spartakus](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/spartakus)

Programs from other OSS communities, for possible inspiration:
* [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/use/cloud-foundry-certified)
* [Android](https://source.android.com/source/faqs.html#compatibility)
* [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix)

Our current cluster conformance tests are described here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/e2e-tests.md#conformance-tests

The current set of tests was the result of an effort to exclude non-portable tests more than to ensure we had adequate/appropriate coverage of the API and functionality surface to ensure a Kubernetes distribution or service conformed.  

Our current node ""conformance"" (validation) tests are described here:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/node-conformance/

These were designed to verify that a node was ready to join a cluster rather than to ensure full coverage of Kubelet functionality. 

Somewhat independent of distribution conformance, it would be useful to have more such component-level validation tests, especially for all pluggable components, such as the pod network, scheduler, ingress controller, service proxy, and state store (etcd).

There are a number of questions that we need to answer, such as how to deal with optional features/components? Clearly required features need to be tested, but it would also be useful to verify correct operation of all features that are present and enabled, using available feature discovery mechanisms.

We likely need to define multiple distribution profiles, such as:
* HA
* Secure
* Multi-tenant

To fully understand our needs and expectations, some help documenting the current state of the Kubernetes CI and ongoing requirements of the Kubernetes community would be useful.

https://github.com/cncf/wg-ci/blob/master/projects/kubernetes.mkd

As we collect Kubernetes and other project CI requirements, we'll use the @cncf/cncf-ci-working-group issue at https://github.com/cncf/wg-ci/issues/12 and encourage you to join the discussion on the [cncf-ci Mailing List](https://lists.cncf.io/mailman/listinfo/cncf-ci-public)

community,ohmystack,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/458,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/458,"Proposal: allow StatefulSet to use RestartPolicy ""OnFailure"" and ""Never""","### Goal

Allow StatefulSet to use the other 2 restart policies: ""OnFailure"" and ""Never"".
It enables to deploy ""run-once + strong identity"" cluster apps using StatefulSet.


### Use Cases:

In machine learning, for training a model in distributed way, we define a bunch of ordered stateful container workers, e.g. ""worker-0"" ""worker-1"" ... ""worker-n"". (They use numbers as their suffix. StatefulSet can manage these continuous numbers for us.)
When training begins, these containers talk to each other by their DNS records. (StatefulSet can help us to create their DNS records.)
When the training is done, all the workers save the result into their persistent volumes and `exit 0`. (StatefulSet helps us to manage their PVs.)
Then, all the stateful Pods stop there in success state, and we still can check their logs.

This is a suitable scene to use StatefulSet, and it is really helpful to allow ""OnFailure"" and ""Never"" RestartPolicy in StatefulSet.


### Declaration

In the original [stateful-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/stateful-apps.md) proposal, it says,

> ""StatefulSets: Running pods which need strong identity and storage"".

The word ""running"" here, is a verb, which means to run something, not to keep something always in a running state.

BTW, it also says,

> ""StatefulSets are considered easy to use for deploying clustered software for common cases.""

A run-once stateful cluster is also a common case.


### Design Points

In the original design of StatefulSet, it only allows the RestartPolicy ""Always"".

If we can allow the RestartPolicy ""OnFailure"" and ""Never"", the Pods in StatefulSet can stay at their final states when their tasks are done, instead of restarting over and over again.

After implementing this proposal, the **default** value of restart policy is still the ""Always"", so that it won't affect the existing StatefulSets. If a user wants to use RestartPolicy ""OnFailure"" and ""Never"" in StatefulSet, they have to **explicitly** set the value, which means that they clearly know what they want to do with their apps.


### Implementation

Modify the method [`isRunningAndReady`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.6.0-beta.3/pkg/controller/statefulset/stateful_set_utils.go#L194-L212) in StatefulSet.

Adding something like this:

```golang
// Determine alive or not based on its restart policy
 switch pod.Spec.RestartPolicy {
 case v1.RestartPolicyNever:
 	// RestartPolicyNever treats all the other phases as alive
 case v1.RestartPolicyOnFailure:
 	if phase != v1.PodRunning && phase != v1.PodSucceeded {
 		return false
 	}
 default:
 	if phase != v1.PodRunning {
 		return false
 	}
 }
```

I had made a PR at kubernetes/kubernetes#42892 of implementing this, and @kow3ns suggested me to have a discussion in community before supplying a PR.


### Question

This seems to be an enhancement to [stateful-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/stateful-apps.md), should I make a PR directly on ""stateful-apps"", or open a new propose, e.g. ""stateful-apps-restartpolicy""?

community,bgrant0607,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/484,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/484,New release notes process and guidance,"Forked from https://github.com/kubernetes/features/pull/204 and other discussions.

We put our release notes here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

The original release-note mechanism design and release changelog template were described here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/release-notes.md

A decision about whether a PR should generate a release note was made merge-blocking in the PR workflow, as described here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/pull-requests.md#release-notes

We subsequently made it possible to both set the labels automatically from the PR template, if properly filled out, and created /release-note commands to enable non-maintainers to set the labels, as described here:

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/pull-request-commands.md#set-release-notes

We also subsequently developed the features repo and process, from which some of the release notes are created by hand, based on which features target the release.

It's clear that the release-note mechanism in the kubernetes repo is causing too much contributor friction, that most people don't know what deserves a release note (e.g., examples, tests, and build scripts shouldn't have release notes) or what would make a good release note, and that the features repo provides another potential mechanism for surfacing release notes.

** What is the purpose of release notes **

Release notes give our users a heads-up about what is coming when they install or upgrade to a particular release of Kubernetes.

They are not primarily for contributors to Kubernetes, who could look at the PRs associated with a particular git tag.

** What deserves a release note **

Any significant user- or admin-visible change. It could be an API change, a CLI change, a UI change, a configuration schema change, a behavioral change, a change in non-functional attributes such as efficiency or availability, availability of a new platform, advance warning about deprecation of a feature, etc.

Fixes of issues previously cited as Known Issues due to the breadth and/or severity of their impact also qualify, as do CVE fixes.

** What doesn't deserve a release note **

Not exhaustive:
* tests (e.g., `Fix TestServiceAlloc flakes`)
* examples
* build infrastructure
* fixes of unreleased bugs
* fixes of minor bugs
* ideally, incomplete/inaccessible features

** What should be in a release note **

* Clear, concise description of the change
  * Explicitly name affected API or configuration fields, CLI commands or flags, relevant feature, measured non-functional changes, etc., in user-visible terms (e.g., using json field names rather than Go field names)
  * State whether it was added, removed, changed, deprecated, advanced in maturity (alpha, beta, stable), etc.
  * Link to relevant user documentation about the feature or, if non-trivial actions are required, about the change itself (yes, docs shouldn't be an afterthought)
  * Make the information relevant to and actionable by admins or users, if necessary.  (For example, `Fix GCI mounter issue` is not.)
* Appropriately categorized
  * Feature
  * Action required
  * Deprecation announcement
  * Other notable change, categorized by component or feature area (not by contributor concepts such as SIG or code repo)

We also need some way of reporting known issues left unaddressed in the release, and recommended versions of dependencies (e.g., etcd, container runtimes), along with their known issues.

1. Use PodTemplate to store DaemonSet history 
1. Use ""pod-template-generation"" to label both pods and PodTemplates, so that DaemonSet controller can map a pod to a PodTemplate (history), and than compare PodTemplate with DaemonSet template 
1. Each PodTemplate is a snapshot of DaemonSet template + annotation + templateGeneration at the moment. A DaemonSet can have multiple PodTemplates with the same template (each with a unique pod-template-generation label)
1. Default clean up policy for DaemonSet history is 2. Only PodTemplates with no existing pods map to it can be cleaned up (so that a pod can always be mapped to a PodTemplate). 
1. Rollback will be done server side using RollbackConfig, similar to Deployment 

An alternative is to create a DaemonSetHistory resource, and/or use template hash instead of template generation.

community,maxim28,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/530,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/530,Confused with CheckNodeMemoryPressure,"The Algorithm document says:

> CheckNodeMemoryPressure: Check if a pod can be scheduled on a node reporting memory pressure condition. Currently, no BestEffort should be placed on a node under memory pressure as it gets automatically evicted by kubelet.

i think it means all pods except BestEffort will be checked for NodeMemoryPressurePredicate, is that right? but when i investigated the code, which means No BestEffort Pods will not be checked?

```
func CheckNodeMemoryPressurePredicate(pod *v1.Pod, meta interface{}, nodeInfo *schedulercache.NodeInfo) (bool, []algorithm.PredicateFailureReason, error) {
    var podBestEffort bool
    if predicateMeta, ok := meta.(*predicateMetadata); ok {
        podBestEffort = predicateMeta.podBestEffort
    } else {
        // We couldn't parse metadata - fallback to computing it.
        podBestEffort = isPodBestEffort(pod)
    }
    // pod is not BestEffort pod
    if !podBestEffort {
        return true, nil, nil
    }

    // is node under presure?
    if nodeInfo.MemoryPressureCondition() == v1.ConditionTrue {
        return false, []algorithm.PredicateFailureReason{ErrNodeUnderMemoryPressure}, nil
    }
    return true, nil, nil
}
```

Similar in CheckNodeDiskPressurePredicate, the document says

> CheckNodeDiskPressure: Check if a pod can be scheduled on a node reporting disk pressure condition. Currently, no pods should be placed on a node under disk pressure as it gets automatically evicted by kubelet.

i think it means all pods will be checked for NodeDiskPressurePredicate, and the code describe the same thing:

```
func CheckNodeDiskPressurePredicate(pod *v1.Pod, meta interface{}, nodeInfo *schedulercache.NodeInfo) (bool, []algorithm.PredicateFailureReason, error) {
    // is node under presure?
    if nodeInfo.DiskPressureCondition() == v1.ConditionTrue {
        return false, []algorithm.PredicateFailureReason{ErrNodeUnderDiskPressure}, nil
    }
    return true, nil, nil
}
```

So anything wrong with the CheckNodeMemoryPressurePredicate? Or i misunderstood the meaning of CheckNodeMemoryPressurePredicate? Please help me figure it out, thank you very much.

community,idvoretskyi,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/531,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/531,"Feature repo and SIG PM should track ""efforts"", not ""features""","_From @countspongebob on April 11, 2017 21:39_

Creating this issue per the SIG PM discussion today. Linking this issue to Ihor's proposed feature lifecycle doc and the governance PM discussion as requested during the call.

Linking to governance umbrella seems sensible, as the Seven need to ensure they either define or define who will own the overall change control process.

Draft feature lifecycle doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-D_QP2IC5Z_QJUmTOV24IsFknc9pGPU5xeq6gjP4f38/edit
). (Note that this proposal would also rename this to a ""effort submission process"".

Use of the word ""feature"" implies that that some new API call or new functional behavior of kubernetes is scope of the repo or the PM SIG. This also starts to beg the question ""what is a feature"". 

Proposing that the scope is instead a chunk of work of sufficiently large or significant scope that it should tracked and visible across the entire community with the following guidelines:

Your proposed work might belong in the ""effort repo"" if:
- It's a feature that would show up in blog
- It's something that would end up in the release notes
- If it crosses SIG boundaries
- If it affects a lot of developers 
- If it affects a lot of users

Checklists, review, and timing of all significant chunks of work (whether features or not) demand the same level of rigor and process.

Proposing feature repo should be renamed and SIG PM scope clarified.

-Bob

community,jsafrane,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/543,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/543,Proposal for user configuration of dynamic provisioning,"This is counter-proposal for https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/247. I've been talking to @msau42 and @saad-ali and with upcoming scheduler changes it would be much better not to allow generic selector as proposed in #247, which is hard to evaluate and allow only exact configuration of dynamic provisioning using ConfigMaps in user namespace(s).

I leave both PRs open and close one when we decide which way to go.

Pros of ConfigMaps:

  *  PVCs are platform independent, as long as user supplies updated `ConfigMap(s)` when deploying to another platform.

  * It is strict and thus easier to handle in the provisioner and in scheduler. No selectors like ""zone NOT IN [east, west]""

Cons:

 * It works only with dynamic provisioning.
   * With Selectors, user might request a PV with certain labels and a PV would be provisioned *only* if no existing PV matched.
   * With `ConfigMap`, a PV must be always dynamically provisioned as we don't have any way how to check if an existing PV conforms to a `ConfigMap`.

 * One extra object to care about.

 * External dynamic provisioners must be able to read all ConfigMaps on the system. This should be OK as long as users don't use ConfigMaps for their mysql passwords.


Again, ""zone"" is used here just for an example, it may be phased out by upcoming scheduler changes, but we still need a way how to configure encryption or nr. of Gluster replicas.

PROCESS/DOCUMENTATION REQUEST

**Description**:

At the release of Kubernetes 1.6.0, the `kubeadm` tool had a [showstopping flaw](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43815) that caused every user who tried to initialize a cluster to face a hung process. The GitHub issue contained a noisy mixture of duplicate reports of the bug, users suggesting workarounds, some developers tracking the short-term fix efforts, and others discussing the correct long-term fix. It was [criticized](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43815#issuecomment-291262557) for having very low signal/noise for any of these audiences and for Kubernetes having no public announcement to the community about the known bug or an estimated fix timeline. Additionally, communication was fractured between [multiple](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/212) GitHub [issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43815) and Slack channels, with no indication of the authoritative source for updates.

In the event that this kind of situation occurs again, it would be great if we put some forethought into the correct way to proceed in the face of panic, and have a playbook for managing our communication. These are the kinds of things I would expect such a document to cover:

- What is the criteria for engaging this process (e.g. X% of estimated users impacted)?
- Who should be engaged within the organization?
- Where should a proactive user announcement (if any) be sent to?
- We should always identify the authoritative source for updates on the status of the bug and its fix, and link/close new issues that duplicate it.
  - Should we create different GitHub issues for different target audiences of the same bug (user reports, workarounds, status of official fix...)?
- Incorporate other useful policies like GoLang's [NoMeToo](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/NoMeToo) to aggressively remove noise.

This is one of the proposed action items from the [kubeadm 1.6.0 postmortem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-wJ39O8eqBxOCHgu0MGmgH4EdojzI3WlrsV3TVwhe0/edit?usp=sharing).",closed,False,2017-04-21 21:28:37,2018-04-05 05:42:53

  * Feature branches -- discuss in #566
  * Feature gating
* Release process changes
  * LTS releases
  * Versioning scheme
  * Release notes
  * Feature/effort-tracking process
* Documentation process and how to support documentation for multiple releases
* Redefining supported version skew, and making it work
* What testing would be necessary to ensure stability and backward compatibility
* Further automation of upgrade tests (e.g., https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/35078)
* What upgrade procedures/tools would be tested?
* Expression of which releases work for a given feature, test, Helm chart, etc.
* Impact on conformance certification approach -- #432

The K8s software conformance [working group](https://ponymail.cncf.io/thread.html/Zse5s4ind7utvjd) is maintaining a public [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LxSqBzjOxfGx3cmtZ4EbB_BGCxT_wlxW_xgHVVa23es/edit#gid=0) of all known Kubernetes offerings, which was initially created by @josephjacks.

I propose adding a security contact column to the spreadsheet and soliciting the security contact (or comma separated list of contacts) for each offering.  Some comments and open questions:

* Here are some details on how the Linux kernel distro list is managed: https://lwn.net/Articles/566123/
* Many folks (including CNCF staff) are monitoring the spreadsheet, and only @josephjacks and I can edit, so we should be able to avoid bad actors adding their email addresses.
* I presume we should limit security contacts to come from the appropriate domain (e.g., redhat.com for OpenShift).
* Can we just email new submissions to kubernetes-security@googlegroups.com or is there a better process for administering list membership? We would escalate any questionable entries to the security group.

What the pod really needs with shared mount propagation is `/var/lib/kubelet`. All the rest **should** be either rslave or private and it breaks things when it's rshared:

* Docker creates `/dev/shm` when running the container. `/dev/` is shared between the host and the container -> anything that the host had in `/dev/shm` is lost. In addition, docker does not unmount it from some reason when the container dies. Private or rshared mount propagation would be enough for `/dev`.
* I need `/sys` in the container to be able to talk to Ceph kernel module, however systemd in the container can't work with `/sys/fs/cgroup` as shared. It simply refuses to start. I need systemd to kill reap zombies of fuse daemons and to start NFS client daemons and `iscsid` during container startup. Now I am stuck with non-systemd init. Private or rshared mount propagation would be enough for `/sys`.
* I have PR to make `/var/lib/kubelet/ as shared during kubelet startup (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/45724). This won't be enough, because now I need `/etc`, `/dev`, `/sys` and `/run` as shared too.

IMO, exporting a HostPath as shared should be opt-in per VolumeHost (or VolumeMount), it should not be enabled by default for all HostPath volumes as agreed in the proposal.

But I can't find a documentation to explain these teams. When I click the team name within the comments, I get a 404 error.

There are some questions, which I think other contributors might have also.

- how many such teams are there? Yes we have a documentation [sig-list](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md), but there is nothing about such @ teams in the doc. 

- does each sig foo all have these teams? i.e. `kubernetes/sig-foo-bugs`, `kubernetes/sig-foo-pr-reviews`, `kubernetes/sig-foo-feature-requests`, `kubernetes/sig-foo-misc`.

- what's the responsibility of these teams? By the name, what I can think is debugging, PR reviewing. What's of the team `kubernetes/sig-foo-misc`?

- what's the naming rules of these teams? We have `kubernetes/sig-apps-pr-reviews`, `kubernetes/sig-apps-bugs` which seems to have a good naming rule. I also see team name like `kubernetes/test-infra-maintainers`, `k8s-sig-openstack-bugs`, `kubernetes/kubectl`. How can contributors know the teams if they never ever see them before?

- who are in the team? I can't find a member list of a team anywhere. I just get a 404. The reason what I can think is that the team is a mail list, we don't want to public our member's mail, right?

- how to join such a team? If some contributors want to help more for community by joining some such teams, how to join?

- why can't non-members mention these teams? In the past, non-members can't mention these teams at all. Currently, non-members can mention the teams, and the bot will help to trigger a notification to the team. Then why don't we allow contributors trigger a notification directly?

- ...

If I unset `CDPATH` or remove the leading period (i.e., have it start with a colon), things work fine.

I asked for help on Slack and got the information that the `CDPATH` must be updated accordingly, and I was asked to submit a documentation-updating PR. IMHO, Kubernetes should be able to build without relying to `CDPATH` having some particular format (especially since the bash man-page shows an example with the current directory in the lead). However, a bit of trial-and-error on my side showed that this might not be super easy to achieve. Hence, I suppose updating the docs is in order.

@jpeeler
Referring to  
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/all-in-one-volume.md

I'd like to be able to create a container configMap like
```
/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
               /telegraf.d/input1.conf
                          /input2.conf
```

My configmaps are
telegraf> kubectl --namespace=kube-system create configmap telegraf-conf --from-file=telegraf.conf
telegraf> kubectl --namespace=kube-system create configmap telegraf-d --from-file=telegraf.d

projected type volumes gets me very close

It is possible to create the configMap contents with a directory but I see no way to place a file beside that mounted folder.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/

Here is my attempt
```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
        name: telegraf
        namespace: kube-system
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          k8s-mon: telegraf
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: telegraf
          image: telegraf
          command: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']    # over-ride telegraf command to allow inspection
          volumeMounts:
            - name: telegraf
               mountPath: /etc/telegraf
###            - name: telegraf-d              # tried as both a single volumeMount and two nested ones
###               mountPath: /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d
      volumes:
      - name: telegraf
         projected:
           sources:
            - configMap:
                 name: telegraf-conf
                   items:
                   - key: telegraf.conf
                      path: telegraf.conf
            - configMap:
                 name: telegraf-d
#                items:
#                 - key: data
#                    path: telegraf.d
##                  - key: 10-redis.conf
##                   path: telegraf.d/10-wavefront.conf
##                - key: 20-prometheus.conf
##                    path: telegraf.d/20-prometheus.conf
```
Single '#' was another attempt to refer to the directory as the parent of the files, ie, 'data' in the spec.
Double '##' was attempting to ref keys in the config map by name.  This works if you remove the 
telegraf-conf configmap mounted at /etc/telegraf.

I also attempted constructing the configmap like so
kubectl --namespace=kube-system create configmap teltest --from-file=telegraf.conf --from-file=telegraf.d

but configmap flattens the contents of telegraf.d to the same level as telegraf.conf

And I tried giving a keyName to the directory
kubectl --namespace=kube-system create configmap teltest2 --from-file=telegrafconf=telegraf.d
error: cannot give a key name for a directory path.


The relevant output from 
```
> kubectl --namespace=kube-system describe deploy/telegraf

      Mounts:
        /etc/telegraf from telegraf (rw)
        /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d from telegraf-d (rw)
    Volumes:
     telegraf:
    <unknown>
     telegraf-d:
    <unknown>
```
But inside the container, only the /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf is mounted (no errors afaik)

There doesn't seem to be a way to place a file beside a dir in a projected volume which is required to support standard unix conf.d configurations.  The workaround for now is the entrypoint script copying a file from /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/telegraf.conf to /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf

community,ericchiang,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/832,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/832,add proposal for subresourced secrets,"cc @kubernetes/sig-auth-misc 

This is a proposal to require accessing secret data through a subresource, with list and watch operations not returning the data for secrets that opt-in to the feature. This feature been mulling around in my head ever since @liggitt brought it up in sig-auth. Wanted to write up and formalize the thought.

This notably isn't part of the existing secrets roadmap.[1] Would like to get some review from the people working on that.

- Magic values for the names of objects as used in reference; ie, when a field that holds a reference to a k8s resource takes on a special value, the behavior of the enclosing resource changes
- Magic values for non-reference fields

- A slash command like /help-wanted to apply the label (this command should only apply to issues)

This would keep the label more relevant, allow its addition/removal by a wider group outside of just k/k maintainers, and provide more start points for new contributors.

We should also decide if `for-new-contributors` is still useful, and if perhaps it could be used in a similar way.

This request fails if the resource does not exist. It succeeds if the resource has previously been created. Using `PUT` does therefore not seem to 'Create or Update a Resource', but rather only 'Update a Resource'.

Is the documentation incorrect or does it for some reason not apply to the resource type `Deployments`? (We have also tested with `Services` and seen the same behavior).

community,pmorie,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/892,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/892,There should be a kubernetes contributor guide,"I've been working on the [service-catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) incubator repo for around the last 11 months.  The service-catalog is an extension project shaped similarly to kubernetes from an architectural perspective:

- It has a distinct API server that is used via the aggregator
- The API server is backed by a controller that has the same state-reconciler architecture as the controllers in the core
- It uses the kubernetes apiserver and apimachinery projects as dependencies

The people participating in the SIG were initially largely unfamiliar with our architectural patterns and conventions.  This was a bit jarring for me as a Kubernetes OG - as has been written elsewhere, we have a lot of knowledge transmitted as oral history that isn't written down.  One big takeaway from this experience is that it would be extremely useful to have a developer guide for kubernetes and projects like the service-catalog that use the same patterns and have a goal of becoming first class projects under the kubernetes github org.

We have fragments of this knowledge written down already, mostly living in the [contributors/devel](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel) directory in this repo:

- [API conventions doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md)
- [API changes doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md)
- [Adding an API group doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/adding-an-APIGroup.md)
- [Coding conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/coding-conventions.md)

... amongst others.  However, these pieces are sprinkled in with a bunch of other stuff that lives in the same directory which is very specific to certain niche topics.

These pieces also don't tell all of the story.  For example, the API conventions document doesn't address certain aspects of API design doctrine like how to differentiate behavioral modes for resources (see #859).

In our experience so far in the catalog incubator, we have tended to spend a lot of time discussing these topics which have been resolved already in the minds of many senior core contributors.

It would be great to have these pieces brought together into a coherent whole that is maintained as we evolve conventions.  Ideally, someone new to the community would be able to read this guide and have a more than minimal grounding in the concepts necessary to understand existing code and a good idea of how to get started thinking 'the kubernetes way'.  In addition to making it easier to onboard new community members, it would help conserve time for SIGs forming around new concepts in the community.

I think this cuts across a number of SIGs:

- API machinery
- Architecture
- Contributor experience

If we have broad interest in creating a guide like this, it might be effective to create a short-term working group to handle bootstrapping the effort of creating the skeleton of the guide from the existing pieces, identifying gaps, and working with the people knowledgeable about those gaps to close them.

Of course, such a document is only useful in the long-term if it is kept up to date, so I think there will be a long-term investment and culture-shift necessary to maintain the dev guide.

- the various groups (e.g steering committee, SIGs, incubator)
- how decisions are made (e.g vote, no vote, lazy consensus etc).
- how each ""project"" is governed (e.g how decisions are made in helm)
- where the community lives which implies where are decisions made.

@kubernetes/sig-auth-bugs

the cmdutil package cannot be found in the path ""k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubectl/cmd/util"".

After diving into Kubernetes auth source code, I want to identify from kubectl to kube-proxy at which part, authentication happens in the traffic flow.

According to the documentation, user first send request to Identity provider, for example GCE using gcloud SDK through oauth2. Then users or accounts visit authentication and authorisation server using ""id_token"", ""access_token"", ""refresh_token"" for subsequent requests.

QUESTION

Hence I need track the visiting traffic to find out where (in which package) and when (some part of the codes handles authentication when request coming, http server should be used here).

It took a few days to go through the relevant codes in following structure

community,dashpole,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/946,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/946,Modify Eviction Strategy to take Priority into account,"Previously, I introduced a number of possible methods for introducing priority: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/846.
We came to agreement on using the strategy:
### Only evict pods where usage > requests.  Then sort by Function(priority, usage - requests)
This solution provides users with a clear path to avoiding evictions. It prevents abuse by high-priority pods by not allowing them to disrupt other pods that are below, or near their requests.  Using a function provides a more nuanced approach to allowing pods to consume ""unused"" (not requested) memory on the node.  Power users, or cluster administrators can determine how unused memory is allocated to pods by choosing priority levels for pods that are closer for more equal sharing of extra memory, or further apart to give better availability to higher priority pods.  For pods that have equal priority, the function is equivalent to usage - requests, so that clusters that do not have priority enabled maintain behavior that is similar (though not exactly the same) as today's behavior.

This PR changes the eviction documentation to include this change in the eviction strategy, and removes outdated information on inode eviction.

Are cherry-picks to older branches automatically carried to newer branches? If so, should the milestone be set to the oldest branch? If not, how can a cherry-pick be applied to multiple branches?

Therefore we should introduce some generic versioning mechanism so old provisioner that don't support new features know that a newer feature is requested and not provision a PVC.

There are two new annotations introduced, one that makes the PVCs that need newer features invisible to the old provisioner, second one introduces very simple versioning based on Kubernetes release.

We missed this in 1.8 development and now it becomes a bug. Should we fix it before 1.8 is released?

2. Changes the strategy from (usage > requests, func(priority, usage - requests)) to (usage > requests, priority, usage - requests)

The PR also covers changes proposed to Cluster Autoscaler to work better with preemption.

For CPU and Memory allocatable, enforcing allocatable through cgroups provides protection from being starved of compute resources by user pods.
However, for ephemeral-storage it seems that the node-level enforcement mechanisms are able to prevent the node from running out of disk, and thus prevent impact to system daemons.
Additionally, memory usage metrics read from cgroups or statfs are far more reliable than an aggregation of `du` calls which may be collected at different times (as https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/52336 demonstrated).
(As a side note, we should read from the /kubepods cgroup to determine allocatable memory usage)
We should still keep the scheduling aspects of node allocatable for ephemeral storage, as this allows for proper accounting.  But I would like to remove enforcement of node allocatable for ephemeral storage.

In https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1409, a /guide folder is being created in k/community/contributors, and its README is set up to be the central starting point for contributing.

This issue is an umbrella tracking issue. Below is a list of check boxes for individual items that need fixing. Some are easy, others require some expertise/experience as a contributor. 

**To help out:**
1. Pick a checkbox item. You will find prompts in the README to where these improvements are needed; they should mostly parallel these check points.
2. Ping me or this issue so I can update this comment next to the checkpoint to say that you are working on this.
3. When finished with the item, submit a PR. In many cases, we will want to re-write, move, and/or remove a linked reference. This should be reflected in the PR. All contributing specific information (i.e. GitHub workflow) should ultimately live in k/community/contributors/guide. _The ultimate goal is to have a single source of truth for all these topics._
4. Comment on your PR with a note like ""...in partial completion of..."" and refer to this issue.
5. Follow up with me to make sure I crossed off the checkbox as completed.

**List of tasks**
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes/contributing.md -> point to community/contributors/guide/README.md
_Thank you, @anubhakushwaha!_

- [x] kubernetes/community/CONTRIBUTING.md -> Needs a rewrite to reflect only k/community-specific contributing guidelines

- [x] kubernetes/community/README.md -> Needs a rewrite to talk about k/community specifically and what it does

- [x] Individual SIG contributing documents -> add a link to community/contributors/guide/README.md _List of SIGs with contributing docs in_ [comment below](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1413#issuecomment-358127594).

- [x] Generate TOC for community/contributors/guide/README.md

- [x] Document should point at developer guide _being worked on by RyanJ from RedHat (?)_ @castrojo _there's a link to resources pointing at top level README in /devel_

- [x] consolidate the Code Review principles from several sources, and find a good place in /guide/README.md where it flows best

- [x] This README will reinvent the contributor's guide. Ensure all relevant information from https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/welcome-to-kubernetes-new-developer-guide.md (_Edit: this file has been incorporated_)and https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/development.md has been correctly ported and the original files deprecated (see additional task list below)

- [x] Clarify help-wanted issues also exist on projects other than k/kubernetes, e.g. k/kubectl.

- [x] Clarify how someone would find the correct SIG, and what to do with that information. Link to those SIGs.

- [x] [This paragraph](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/issues.md#find-the-right-sigs) helps to find the SIG for an existing issue; what about a PR not associated with an open issue? Clarify/link/rewrite.

- [x] Make reader aware each SIG may have special additional contributing guidelines

- [x] Possible text to elaborate on (the sig list should remain in its current place however):
[Pick a SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md), peruse its associated [cmd](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd) directory, find a main() and read code until you find something you want to fix.

- [x] clarify there are many k/subrepos where you can file issues. Refer to ""how to find an appropriate SIG"" document to find out which.

- [x] move [github workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/development.md#workflow) into its own file in this folder. _edit; working on this currently 1/2_

- [x] Clarify and streamline some of the code review explanations from [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/owners.md#code-review-process). Explain OWNERS files and process. _Thank you to @tpepper for this!_

- [x] Create (or find) and link to a document that explains kubernetes testing, how to use it, where to find test output, explain debugging, etc. Also link to testing pipelines.

- [x] Create Security subsection of Contributing section @castrojo will follow and create issue

- [x] Provide link and starter kit contact/packet for Kubernetes Meetups

- [x] Provide description and link for Kubernetes Pilots.

- [x] Move contributor cheatsheet to /guide folder

- [x] We have an `area/contributor-guide` label now, we can tag all the issues with that and just link to it once from the main contributor guide readme instead of inlining tasks in the document itself, this will clean up the index considerably. 

/sig contribex

 ### Files to scrub

Each of these files in the `contributors/devel` needs to be scrubbed for the contributor guide. As they are finished they should be moved over to `contributors/guide`. Non-contributor relevant topics should remain in `contributors/devel`, so there are some calls to make.

They are written by multiple people and might contain years of cruft, check for:
- Duplicate content that can be removed, so for example, don't leave in a copy of the CoC, change it to a link to the canonical URL in here.
- Might not be appropriate for the contributor guide (mark it off and add a reason)
- Might need to be ouright be deleted or combined with another document :D
- Might be blocked on waiting on another part of the contributor guide to be finished.

A FAQ or debug section in https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/testing.md would be useful to guide contributors toward understanding failures, seeing if they're hitting a top current flake (eg: http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/bigquery-metrics?orgId=1), checking if there is an https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Akind%2Fflake issue is already tracking the problem or if they should ""/kind flake"", enable them to find and watch for the specific change they need to see merged before bothering to ""/retest"", etc.",open,False,2017-12-20 18:43:16,2019-01-23 11:37:20

It's a pain point for multi-zone clusters deployment since cross-zone network traffic being charged, while in-zone is not. In addition, cross-node traffic may carry sensitive metadata from other nodes. Therefore, users always prefer the service backends that close to them, e.g. same zone, rack and host etc. for security, performance and cost concerns.

Kubernetes scheduler can constraining a pod to only be able to run on particular nodes/zones. However, Kubernetes service proxy just randomly picks an available backend for service routing and this one can be very far from the user, so we need a topology-aware service routing solution in Kubernetes. Basically, to find the nearest service backend.

Actually, we are working on a POC about this proposal and there was strong support for us to open source this work, which we are happy to do.

The additional role makes the contributor ladder more complicated.  It's also just as much if not more effort to administer the role, and more difficult to audit across repos and orgs.

The only real benefit the additional role adds is constraining people's ability to use certain commands to specific repos instead of all repos in the org they're a member of (eg: /lgtm, /close, /assign).  

When discussed during a sig-contribex meeting, there was agreement on simplifying and cutting the role.  Unfortunately, this agreement didn't land in meeting notes, and I haven't seen the video recording hit youtube yet.

I think we could benefit from a survey of where and how extensively the role is used today across kubernetes/* and kubernetes-incubator/* repos.  This is something only people with... write? admin? access to said repos can do.  But IMO anyone is free to tackle modifying community-membership.md and I'm happy to review PR's to that effect.

community,spiffxp,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1579,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/1579,Propose replacing github label priority/failing-test with kind/failing-test,"As CI Signal Lead for 1.9 I often found myself filing issues with `priority/critical-urgent` `priority/failing-test`.  Having two priorities assigned to an issue seems... weird.  I think the idea was to encourage folks to prioritize failing tests as the most important thing.  I'm not sure how well that has worked in practice.

It would make more sense to me if we called it `kind/failing-test`, to separate from `kind/bug` or `kind/flake`.  I could then say that https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/6095 holds true, that an issue should only ever have one priority label applied to it.

I went digging through devstats and maybe it hurts my case.  It does look like `priority/failing-test` issues get closed a little more quickly than `priority/critical-urgent` issues.  That said, I would argue it comes from effectively triaging failing tests into a bucket, not so much that the bucket has the word ""priority"" in it.

@zcahana:
> Would it be reasonable to extend this definition (perhaps as SLI2) to measure the e2e watch latency, i.e. from the moment a POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE is invoked, and until the corresponding watch notification is sent to each/all watchers?
>
>This would allow to reason about the latencies perceived both by individual watchers, and by the entire system.
>
>A derived SLO, if defined, can place a bound on latency, depending on the number of watchers.

@wojtek-t:
> Re this particular thing: I'm open to suggestions, but it's not easy to do in general. First: when does it start? I imagine that when the request reaches apiserver (which already makes it not really e2e). Second, how would you like to solve the problem of HA setups and clock skew.

@zcahana:
> Regarding ""when does it start"":
Ideally we'd start measuring when the client issues the API call, but obviously that requires some synchronization - of the clocks, a well as correlating the timestamps recorded at client/server sides.
If that turns up too complex, we can start measuring when the API server receives the request. That's indeed ""less"" e2e-ish, but anyway the dominant factor is expected to be the time it takes to disseminate the watch notification to the watchers.
>
> Regarding clock skews:
(handwaving) I guess we can use NTP to get a milliseconds-order synchronization in an HA setup, which is probably accurate enough for the subject matter, given the expected latencies at scale.

@wojtek-t:
> We don't require users to have any kind of NTP. And we don't want ot introduce this requirement to make some metrics reliable.

@zcahana:
> I probably misunderstood your question about clock skews. My answer was with respect to how we setup the test environment, involving multiple servers, such that their clocks are ""synchronized enough"" so we can derive durations (latencies) from start/end timestamps reported from different servers. That doesn't impose any requirements on users - only on the test setup.",closed,False,2018-01-09 16:53:48,2018-11-07 19:46:41

### Trivial Edits

Each incoming Pull Request needs to be reviewed, checked, and then merged.
While automation helps with this, each contribution also has an engineering cost. Therefore it is appreciated if you do NOT make trivial edits and fixes, but instead focus on giving the entire file a review.
If you find one grammatical or spelling error, it is likely there are more in that file, you can really make your Pull Request count by checking formatting, checking for broken links, and fixing errors and then submitting all the fixes at once to that file.
Some questions to consider:
- Can the file be improved further?
- Does the trivial edit greatly improve the quality of the content?

community,spiffxp,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1673,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/1673,Formalize the concept of subprojects,"This is based on / inspired by a [SIG Architecture proposal to expand SIG metadata and flesh out OWNERS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHauGII5LNVM-dZcNfzYZ-6WRs9RoPctQ4bw5dczrkk/edit#)

This is driven by a steering committee goal of ensuring that our organizational structure maps to our code structure.

> Every part of the Kubernetes code and documentation should be owned by a Special Interest Group (SIG). However, many SIGs have multiple significant subprojects with distinct (though sometimes overlapping) sets of contributors and owners, who act as subproject’s technical leaders: responsible for vision and direction and overall design, choose/approve change proposal (KEP) approvers, field technical escalations, etc. We should formally recognize that.

> For example, SIG Network potentially could be divided into multiple subprojects: pod networking (CNI, etc.), Service, Ingress, DNS, and Network policy. SIG Apps has the workload APIs, Helm, and Kompose. SIG Cluster Lifecycle has kubeadm, kops, kubespray, minikube, etc. SIG API machinery has apiserver, client libraries, API discovery and OpenAPI, CRD, API aggregation, and admission extension. In addition to Kubelet proper, SIG Node has multiple CRI implementations underway. Maybe some of these subprojects should be grouped, but hopefully you get the idea.

I'd like to start by implementing this concept in [`sigs.yaml`](/sigs.yaml). This ensures the information is machine-readable, generated README's contain human-readable information, and we start with a single source of truth.

Strawman:
- a sig may have N subprojects
- a subproject must have a name
- a subproject must have 1 - N OWNERS files associated with it
- the OWNERS files define the root of the repos/subdirectories owned by the subproject
- a subproject may have a description
- a subproject may have one or more meetings
- meetings can have different uris for video, agenda, recordings, etc.

Looking at SIG Apps as an example:
- A ""Workloads API"" subproject could potentially span multiple subdirs and repos
- A ""Charts"" subproject spans the kubernetes/charts repo
- A ""Helm"" subproject could potentially span kubernetes/helm and kubernetes-helm/* repos

Looking at SIG Contributor Experience as an example:
- A ""Mentorship"" subproject would own the docs in kubernetes/community that related to mentorship
- A ""Community Management"" subproject would own the docs in multiple subdirs of kubernetes/community

I am putting together an implementation based on this strawman with a _total guess_ of single-repo subprojects based on first-pass by @bgrant0607, so we have a concrete example to iterate on.  The intent isn't to voluntold SIG's into owning repos, but to identify where our gaps lie.

**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**:

/kind feature


**What happened**:
As a Kubernetes community member, it is difficult to attain a good signal-to-noise ratio with regards to GitHub notifications and mailing list messages. 

**What you expected to happen**:
I'd like to get some guidance on how to be an effective communicator in the Kubernetes community. In other words, not be deluged by all the e-mail. Specifically, what to do with GitHub and Gmail to surface the pertinent content and purge the less personally meaningful content.

**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
Join as a Member, help out with more than one SIG.

**Anything else we need to know?**:
N/A

**Environment**:
- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): N/A
- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: N/A
- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): N/A
- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): N/A

There are several applications like SIP apps or RTP which needs a lot of ports to run multiple calls or media streams. Currently there is no way to allow a range in ports in spec. So essentially users may have to do this:

```
- name: sip-udp5060
  containerPort: 5060
  protocol: UDP
- name: sip-udp5061
  containerPort: 5061
  protocol: UDP
  ...
- name: sip-udp5559
  containerPort: 5559
  protocol: UDP
```

Doing above for 500 ports is not pretty. Can we have a way to allow port ranges like 5060-5559?

## Objective

This proposal builds off of earlier requests to [Support port ranges in services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23864) and aims to document all the requirements of supporting port ranges in services.

[Doc explaining MOC](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md)

We need more volunteers for the Ask Us Anything portion and code peer reviewers live. Volunteers can mark their availability [on this sheet (tab for MOC)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OKc4h-0QLKCbncSloRf_gYklpHYVyNxZmfEM9hlK1xQ/edit?usp=sharing). Right now we are only running once a month (first Wednesday) at 730am PST/3:30pm UTC and ideally would like to run twice a month or covering two timezone editions (western and APAC) in the same day. 

Expectations of volunteers -

- Be on 5 mins early
- Be prepared to give advice on contribution process, membership, navigating the kubernetes seas, testing, and general questions about you and your path to open source/kubernetes.
- We will be using video chat (zoom but live streaming through YouTube) but voice only is fine if you are more comfortable with that
- Be willing to provide suggestions and feedback to make this better!

There have been misunderstandings on the means because of the way
accepted has been used elsewhere on the project.

For example, some reviewing the Application object/CRD PR though expected meant implementable or that this was the accepted design direction that would be expected to implement. Since this is a new process I would argue the naming should follow the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) and attempt to be intuitive even to those not familiar with the process (which is most people at the moment).

This proposed change moves the term to draft which is used buy other projects
such as the IETF standards track.

community,technosophos,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1793,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/1793,Confusion over states in the KEP-1 proposal,"This issue arises out of a discussion in SIG-Apps today, and applies to 0001-kubernetes-enhancement-proposal-process.md

For background, there has been movement in the community to use the KEP process for more general standards (e.g. CRDs, conventions, or ecosystem tooling), not just changes to Kubernetes core. This is causing confusion.

The states defined in the KEP-1 (implementable, implemented, deferred, etc.) are significantly different than the states define for RFCs, Rust RFCs, PEPs, and similar specification processes. This is causing confusion about how to actually use KEPs.

Specifically, it appears to be a process designed to handle only _one implementation_ of any given proposal. (`implementable`/`implemented`/`deferred`). Thus it seems only useful for one project that admits only one canonical implementation of a KEP. So it becomes generally unusable when trying to define interchange formats, protocols, schemata, etc.

The core confusion comes from conflating _specification_ and _implementation_. First, an implementation can be achieved against a non-existent or poor specification. Whether something is _implementable_ or _implemented_ does not speak to the quality of the specification. Neither should the existence of an implementation foreclose the possibility of writing a good specification. Second, a specification does not necessarily need ""an implementation"" to be useful. One might ""specify"" the purpose or meaning of labels or annotations, but without having ""an implementation"". (KEP-1, for example, does not have ""an implementation"".)

As a remedial action, I would propose that we do one of two things:

- Agree to not use KEP-1 for anything but proposals to extend the functionality of Kubernetes core, and leave everyone else (SIGs, etc) to figure out their own process
- Supersede KEP-1 with a new KEP that outlines states as they are explained in [the RFC process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) or another standards process that is not strongly tied to just one canonical implementation. ",closed,False,2018-02-12 19:01:02,2018-02-22 16:41:41

It is unclear what to do when your company has signed a CLA. Does the contributor need to sign anything? Obtain a Linux Foundation ID? What if the contributor's github email is different from company email?

Furthermore, if no action on part of a company-approved contributor is necessary, this needs to be clearsly stated in the contributor guide.

K8s implementation:
We can obviously use this at KubeCon as well but longer term strategy would be similar to 1:1 matching mentor programs that we are used to with a twist. Instead of goal setting, regular meetings, etc. in the traditional approach, this would be a one time, one hour session with a contributor at a higher membership level than the individual looking for guidance. 

Tools required:
Matching [form](https://goo.gl/forms/iBmem15vnNKwmSPH2) - we can adjust questions and logic on this one to improve and target this activity. This will be included in the mentoring documentation on GH and K8s.io.

Mentor expectations here would be one hour. The mentor isn't expected to know all of the answers to the questions but should be able to point them to better resources. This will require knowledge of how the community communicates, finding documentation, etc.

Currently the kubenet code supports applying basic traffic shaping during pod setup. This will happen if bandwidth-related annotations have been added to the pod's metadata, for example:

    {
        ""kind"": ""Pod"",
        ""metadata"": {
            ""name"": ""iperf-slow"",
            ""annotations"": {
                ""kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth"": ""10M"",
                ""kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth"": ""10M""
            }
        }
    }

Our current implementation uses the linux tc to add an download(ingress) and upload(egress) rate limiter using 1 root qdisc, 2 class(one for ingress and one for egress) and 2 filter(one for ingress and one for egress attached to the ingress and egress classes respectively).

Kubelet CNI code doesn't support it yet. However, there is enough functionality for us to add a simple CNI plugin to replicate the behavior we have today in kubenet if we feel this is an important feature. In fact, CNI has already supported traffic shaping plugin.

Watching for release-note needed changes, how to feed into the docs process

### Docs/Guides/Content Needed
Common problems?
Discourse in / on PRs, issues, etc. - good, bad, ugly?

### Kops
- Vendoring is different between subprojects. kubernetes/kubernetes uses godep, we use submodules, and maybe dep soon
- docs are generated differently in kubernetes/kubernetes and this causes some confusion with new contributors with code generated docs.
- CI is different with Travis runs, and e2e is sorta the same, but tests kops differently
- our integration testing framework with terraform is unique, because how we are testing that install works, instead of testing that k8s works
- API modifications and additions are far less formal in kops than other projects but are still reviewed with a lot of deliberate focus.

** BUG REPORT**:

> Uncomment only one, leave it on its own line: 
>
 /kind bug
@sig/cluster-lifecycle/kubeadm
> /kind feature


**What happened**:

While deploying kubernetes v1.9.3 cluster using `kubeadm` on Centos 7.4, nodes couldn't reach master API on port 6443.

The command  `# kubeadm join --token 32fcfd.d1eec8c99efe1cfb 10.0.32.140:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6931045ca75e9a9deb08b616467367d5e5d91185adb9bae3455c7b3d68f97800`  on nodes showing the following error

Error:

[discovery] Failed to request cluster info, will try again: [Get https://10.0.32.140:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info:

**What you expected to happen**:
Nodes should be able to communicate with master API, fetch the cluster-info and join the cluster.
**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:

Follow the procedure https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/ 

**Anything else we need to know?**:

After the investigation, it is observers that, the default firewall configuration on `master` node, not permitting incoming traffic to port 6443 in table `IN_public_allow`. After manually adding the incoming rule
 to the table,  nodes are able to communicate with master API and join the cluster.

**Environment**:
- Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`):
- Cloud provider or hardware configuration: 
- OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CentOS 7.4
- Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`): 3.10.0-693.17.1.el7.x86_64

An alternative approach (elaborated on in the KEP) would be to augment the existing `kubeadm-config` directly without the use of additional ConfigMaps. The multiple ConfigMap approach makes more sense to me so that's what I decided to propose. If there is a lot of opposition to this approach, then I'm happy to draft a new KEP.

I will also work on prototyping this as we agreed. I just wanted to get something out there to get a more serious discussion moving.

community,carlolm,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1948,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/1948,[bug] Stateful Set: Dynamic Provisioning of PV/PVC,"## Objective
Create pods with persistent volumes to store large amounts of data that is regularly synced.  The data should persist even if the other modules of the pod are changed or updated.  If a persistent volume is made inactive (for example, scaling down or when restarting the stateful set), when it is re-mounted again by another/new pod, data syncing should resume from when the persistent was previously made inactive; i.e. data should be retained.

## Current behavior
After the persistent volume is disconnected, when resuming, data is reset and syncing starts as if the the persistent volume is empty.

## How to reproduce:
1. Create the stateful set as below
2. Check the logs of the `event-watcher` container of the ""parity set""

```
$ kubectl logs parity-set-1 -c event-watcher --namespace parity-rp

# Example log:
getBlockNumber:
 => 103482
```

This number displayed under getBlockNumber is the currently synced block.
If the persistent volume works as intended, this number should resume from approximately where it was when the pod is disconnected.  If it starts again at `0` upon restarting of the pod/PV connection, it means that the data from the previous sync has not persisted.

3. Restart pods: either by scaling to 1 and scaling back up to 2 (checking `parity-set-1`) or by deleting the stateful set and re-creating (can check both pods)

community,tallclair,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1950,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/1950,[RFC] PodRestriction proposal,"This is a proposal for a new policy object (and associated admission controller) that adds basic restrictions to most fields on a Pod. This is motivated by a desire to unify the various policies we have now (which all behave in slightly different ways), and to unblock expanding the set of restricted fields. Furthermore, it aims to solve some of the key usability problems with PodSecurityPolicies, such as the inability to compose policies and the difficulty in binding policies.

**Help Wanted:** I don't actually have time to own the implementation of this proposal, so I'm looking for community members who are interested in realizing this. If we decide to move forward with this approach, my hope is that we can consolidate some of the efforts around other new restriction policies.

**Question**: Should this be rolled up into the overall [policy proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ht8wpj4j9YfAA7aVv9Yn3Ci1T_MLMWt0DBr0QmxI2OM/edit#heading=h.6l8mozsiyzb1) or something like [OPA](http://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html)? Alternatively, should this use a path-based OPA-style API?

community,jberkus,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1959,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/1959,"Create ""good first issue"" label","The way it is now:

We have the ""help-wanted"" label, which according to [its description](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/15b507ad2f38b5943bc03d0362416c6483665c28/contributors/devel/help-wanted.md) should cover issues which are suitable for work by novice contributors. However, that's not how that label is being used; instead, it's being used for issues which are not making progess because they need additional expertise, input, or large time commitments.  Mostly, these issues require quite advanced knowledge of Kubernetes.  Examples:  [60023](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60023), [56567](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56567).

This means that would-be new contributors, looking for their first place to hack on Kubernetes, can't figure out where to start.  We could try to change member's behavior in using the ""help wanted"" tag, but that seems unlikely to be successful.

What we should do:

1. Add the ""good first issue"" label to automation and all repos that want it.  This includes creating the /good-first-issue and /remove-good-first-issue commands for Prow, and writing a description.
2. Amend the description to the ""help wanted"" label to reflect its actual use.
3. Share the new label, and an explanation of how ""help wanted"" and ""good first issue"" are distinct, with kubernetes-dev, the community meeting and the SIG leads.

The choice of ""good first issue"" here is because Github has public filters for that label.

Updates kubernetes/kubernetes#39845
Feature issue kubernetes/features#135

This PR updates the seccomp design doc to indicate that we are enabling a default seccomp profile: docker/default. It pulls a few pieces from #660, but does not include the seccomp spec. The reasoning here is that we can simply enable docker/default as the first step and see how it works. If strong needs of a different default k8s seccomp profile come up, we can add that later.",closed,True,2018-03-22 21:42:58,2018-05-31 17:59:40

**Steps to reproduce:**
- Read https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api_changes.md#generate-clientset
- Read https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/generating-clientset.md
- Try to move internal types from one API group to another

**Expected result:**
PROFIT!

**Actual result:**
Generated [clientsets use old types and don't compile](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61608#issuecomment-375765633):

> W0323 18:55:08.870] pkg/client/clientset_generated/internalclientset/typed/extensions/internalversion/podsecuritypolicy.go:38:42: undefined: extensions.PodSecurityPolicy

In this case, it's unclear what the logic it uses and why it doesn't use types from a new API group.

* add a table of contents:  this does appear to happen as they render elsewhere later in the publication flow, but would make some aspects of review easier on this very long document
* add a security section (could relate to issue #1568 to have a special notation so these are easily queried for the notes)
* add sections for new alpha, graduated alpha to beta, and graduated beta to ga items
* build a linter to check basic misspeillings, backticking of dash dash command line parameters, probably many many other things the rel note wrangler regularly manually does

Feel free to assign yourself to a section


### Slack
Assignee: @parispittman

- [ ] Channels - Anything out of place or not following the guidelines? 
  - [ ] Close unused channels. 
  - [ ] Check to see if there is a purpose, pinned documents like agendas, and other best practices being used in the channel. These are not required but are useful.
- [ ] Audit the Integrations and apps
- [ ] Audit the user tokens
- [x] Audit the Emojis
- [ ] Generate a Slack data report to share with the community (optional)

### GitHub

- [x] Audit Org admin permissions
- [ ] Audit Integrations
- [ ] Check Label usage (education, deprecation, etc)
- [ ] Is the PR and/or issue message still good/the best?
- [ ] Check kubernetes/community/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
- [ ] Where’s the issue template located? 

### Calendars
Assignee: @castrojo

- [x] Check that the calendar works
  - Go to http://k8s.io/community and follow the flow
- [ ] Make sure all SIG, WG, and other community meetings are showing - especially check new groups that were created in the last quarter
- [ ] Make sure that invites have more than one owner, shared with the mailing list distro, and have an agenda attached plus zoom URL and telephone dial information.

### SIGS

- [ ] Ensure everyone in `sigs.yaml` is subscribed to sigs-leads mailing list
- [ ] Ensure that chairs and leads are accurate in the `sigs.yaml`

### YouTube
Assignee: @castrojo

- [ ] Check sharing on all the playlists
  - Should only be shared with leads or people appointed by leads
  - Either remove other people or regenerate a new collaboration URL
- [x] Check admin permissions on the Kubernetes account
- [x] Fix any videos accidentally tagged as unlisted 
- [x] Generate a YouTube traffic report to share with the community (optional)

### Zoom

- [ ] Ensure leads have access to their upgraded Zoom account
- [ ] If appropriate change the password if a SIG has changed leadership 
  - Contact CNCF to adjust upgraded licenses if necessary
- [ ] Audit kubernetes.io GSuite - this is primarily needed to create associated resources like GoogleGroups and the Google Cloud organization.  Accounts in  this domain cost the CNCF actual money, so are not available for individuals. Three steering committee members will hold the keys to three accounts on the domain, which can be used to create `@kubernetes.io` groups as needed.
  - Volunteers (Ask for new representatives from the steering committee if election turnover affects this list):
    - Joe Beda (@jbeda)
    - Brendan Burns (@brendandburns)
    - Tim Hockin (@thockin)

### Community Meeting

- [ ] Generate an archive of the [communtiy meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit#heading=h.2gp5yf2snwg5) for the quarter if necessary
  - [ ] Ensure the retrospective section has links to the retrospective for the releases
  - [x] Ensure the demo section is filled out and demos are assigned dates
  - [x] Ensure the [agenda template and hosting guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7fR5cvCGFq15SJ4iQMclbj0QIeREKu_QP8ftnSaJ4o/edit) are up to date 
- [ ] Ensure the [SIG Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adztrJ05mQ_cjatYSnvyiy85KjuI6-GuXsRsP-T2R3k/edit#gid=1543199895) have SIGs assigned for the next few months
  - [ ] Ensure the assigned SIGs in this sheet match the actual SIGs in sigs.yaml. Double check that a SIG hasn't missed an update this past cycle and if they have schedule them for an upcoming meeting

I wanted to open this up in `k/community`, but there's also a superset-ey, omnibus issue around CLAs in kubernetes/kubernetes#27796.

I'm not sure if this is the best place to discuss this, but some interesting cases for contributors are when they:
- transition from individual contributor to employee contributor (or vice versa)
- transition to another company e.g., Red Hat acquisition of CoreOS

I'm personally still under the CoreOS CLA, because I'm concerned that there isn't a well defined process for transitioning to another company, and I don't want to impede my ability to contribute.

There are some great comments on that omnibus thread that ask similar questions:
- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27796#issuecomment-327943347
- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27796#issuecomment-365554340

It appears that the silver bullet is to contact helpdesk@rt.linuxfoundation.org for assistance, but it would be nice to actually document some of these use cases, so people know what to expect when hitting them (which I'm happy to help do).

Some things I noticed about the Linux Foundation ID:
- one username
- if you're using GitHub as your auth provider (which I did, not sure if that's strictly required or not) then it would make sense that you could only connect that GH account to a single LF identity
- required to use my work email to sign up for the account and the CKA exam
- doesn't appear to support transitioning the account to a different company CLA without helpdesk intervention

It would be cool if I could sign up for one account that held multiple identities (personal, work, etc.) and supported transitioning between different contributor types.

(I'm happy to move this somewhere else, if there's a more appropriate place for this issue.)

community,jberkus,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2032,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2032,Tracking Issue: Normalize Kind Labels,"There are several issues open regarding Kind labels.  This is a tracking issue to track all of them across the project so that people can visualize what the end result will be.

Issues:
* #2014 Lable kind/support should be renamed to triage/
* #1579 Propose replacing github label priority/failing-test with kind/failing-test
* #2013 Add several already-in-use kind labels to official list

Some general points:

1. All else being equal, fewer kind labels is considered a good thing.
2. Kind/ labels which are not explicitly recommended and documented should be considered deprecated.
3. Old kind labels which have not been used since the 1.9 cycle or earlier should be considered deprecated. 
4. Ideally, issues and PRs should be able to treat Kind labels as exclusive (apply only one per PR/issue), although this should not be enforced due to corner cases.

I am vague on how we should be applying this set of rules to K/K vs. organization-wide.  My primary concern is limiting the pool of kind labels in k/k to a relative handful of clearly needed labels.

## New list of canonical Kind labels 

* kind/feature
* kind/bug
* kind/documentation
* kind/failing-test (was priority/failing-test)
* kind/flake (new per #1579)
* kind/cleanup (in use)
* kind/design (in use)
* kind/api-change (in use)
* kind/new-api (in use)

## Deprecated Kind labels:

* kind/support (to triage/support)
* kind/enhancement (duplicates kind/feature)
* kind/technical-debt (duplicates kind/cleanup)

Also officially deprecating these kind labels, which exist but have not been used since 1.9 or earlier:

* kind/friction (?)
* kind/mesos-flake (?)
* kind/old-docs (duplicates kind/documentation)
* kind/postmortem (?)
* kind/upgrade-test-failure (duplicates kind/failing-test) 

## List of Changes To Make

Renames:

* priority/failing-test to kind/failing-test
* kind/support to triage/support

New Labels:

* kind/flake

Existing Labels to be added to labels.md:

* kind/cleanup
* kind/design
* kind/api-change
* kind/new-api

Finally, announce deprecation of all the deprecated labels above, and mark them as such in the label dictionary.

community,easeway,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2052,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2052,KEP: Security Profile Design Proposal,"This is the detailed design proposal for Security Profile.

Security Profile helps managing a secured Kubernetes cluster by solving problems of:

- Management complexity
  - Complicated configuration of control plane components' security-relevant command line flags, correctness of cert/key/config file permissions;
  - Requires deep understanding of Kubernetes policy objects like RBAC, PodSecurityPolicy, NetworkPolicy, ResourceQuota etc;
  - No support for automatic provisioning of namespaced policy objects upon namespace creation;
  - Requires of domain knowledge about security;
  - Requires keeping up with fast evolving Kubernetes security/isolation features, and update configurations accordingly;

- Extra efforts building in-house solutions
  - No standard/common ways to solve the problems;
  - It’s very difficult to make in-house solutions sharable/reusable, as a result, efforts are duplicated solving same/similar problems.

by defining curated settings of:

- Cluster bootstrapping configuration, like command line flags, file permissions, etc
- Cluster-scoped policy objects, like PodSecurityPolicy
- Namespace-scoped policy objects, like NetworkPolicy

And simplify the cluster management by specifying the name of security profile.


_This proposal is looking for sponsorship from sig-auth,
to create a public repo as [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles](),
that community can help curate commonly used security profiles.
Details are described in Release section in the proposal._

For example, if you rename `a.md` to `b.md` in a feature branch, updating an `../a.md` to `../b.md` target will work immediately (e.g. during pull-request review), while updating `https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/a.md` to `https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/b.md` will only work after your branch lands the rename in master.

I'm not sure why the `#L1454` fragment was part of the old sig-governance template sigs.yaml link, but it's been there since the template landed in 68658bff (#1830).  I've removed it in this commit.

The Kubernetes Charter README link in the sig-governance template could just be:

    [Kubernetes Charter README]: README.md

but I've sent it down to the project root and back to make life easier on new SIGs which copy/paste the file to a new location in this repository.  With this pull request they'll just need to drop one level of `../` to get the references working from places like `sig-contributor-experience/charter.md`.

I've also chased a few files and anchors as they've moved around, e.g. the `OBSOLETE_templates.md` rename from 18958f82 (#1010) and the ""and maintenance"" header addition from f471f6b6 (#1215).

Namespace Population is an automated mechanism to make sure the predefined policy objects
(e.g. NetworkPolicy, Role, RoleBinding) are present in selected namespaces.

## Motivation

Kubernetes users create namespaces (self-service namespace creation) and want to
ensure security/isolation policies are enforced between them and other users.
Just like addon manager creates cluster-scope policy objects like PodSecurityPolicy,
ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding at cluster creation time.
It creates namespace-scope policy objects during namespace creation time.

This is part of [Security Profile proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2052)

community,wking,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2183,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2183,SIG charter template: Separate SIG and subproject roles,"By separating the SIG and subproject roles, we can more tightly scope the previous ""Membership for roles tracked in: `sigs.yaml`"".  The SIG
roles are tracked there directly, but subproject roles are incorperated by reference.  Now that the subproject roles are in their own subsection, we can spend a bit more time talking about that indirection.

I've removed ""Seed members established at SIG founding"" from the chairs entry, because its already discussed in `/committee-steering/governance/README.md` (step 4).  There's no need to record that procedure in the charter itself, because the initial membership can be recovered from the version controlled history of `sigs.yaml`.

I've split the previous ""Members"" role into a SIG entry and a subproject entry to clarify that distinction.  The previous member line-items are mostly handled in other places now:

* ""maintain health of at least one subproject or the health of the SIG"", ""show sustained contributions to at least one subproject or to the SIG"", ""hold some documented role"", and ""Includes all reviewers and approvers"" are now addressed by the member definitions.
* ""build new functionality"" is not particularly clear, and for most subprojects anyone can contribute issues, pull requests, etc. without being a formal subproject member.
* ""participate in decision making for the subprojects they hold roles in"" is redundant with the other role definitions.

I've split the previous ""Subproject Owners"" into subproject approvers and reviewers.  This lets us define subproject members to include both
approvers and reviewers while restricting control over some activity (adjusting the `OWNERS` file) to approvers.  The ""alter their own `OWNERS`"" wording makes that line generic enough to allow for managing both approvers and reviewers, as well as anything else that the `OWNERS` file covers.

There is no implicit `OWNERS` nesting, all `OWNERS` entries must be listed in `sigs.yaml`.  This is a bit more work for `sigs.yaml` maintainers, but allows for owner/approver calculation without walking all referenced repositories.  We also have existing cases where parent and child `OWNERS` files are in different SIGs/subprojects.  For example, kubernetes/kubernetes has `/test/e2e/apps/OWNERS` in the workloads-api
subproject of SIG Apps, while the parent `/test/OWNERS` is in the testing-commons subproject of SIG Testing.

Because of the repo-root restriction, security contacts have an added wrinkle for nested subprojects.  The way I've worded it, kubernetes/kubernetes security contact would be a member of all subprojects with an `OWNERS` file in that repository (assuming the associated SIG had adopted wording like what I'm proposing with this pull request).  Members don't have many teeth (they mostly SHOULD approve things), and security contacts will have lots of trust, so the broad association here shouldn't cause any problems.

I've added a SHOULD for estabilishing security contacts for new repositories.  This will probably happen even without the reminder, but it's nice to be explicit.

I've also made assorted minor copy-edits near lines I touched.

community,danielepolencic,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2210,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2210,Revisiting pod autoscaling on a queue based architecture,"@kubernetes/sig-autoscaling-proposals
@kubernetes/sig-autoscaling-reviews

The [current best practice to autoscale pods based on the number of messages in a queue](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/external-metrics-autoscaling) is to use an HPA with a metric of type External.

While this is good in theory, it's somewhat inconvenient in practice.

As a developer, I'd rather not expose the underlying message broker. In fact, I'd probably create an abstraction to access it.
If later on, I wish to replace RabbitMQ with Kafka, I can make the change and be confident that nothing will break because the public interface hasn't changed.

So while _External_ might have specific use cases, it's a less convenient way to scale my (micro) services since it exposes the message broker directly.

A more attractive option is to wrap the queue into a microservice.

Imagine you have a publisher, a consumer and a queue that decouples the two.
The publisher sends messages to the queue, the consumer picks them up at its own pace.

Typically, I'd expose custom metrics for the queue from the consumer, the publisher or both since they already know how to talk to the queue.
If you access `/metrics` on the consumer, you should expect a custom metric that contains the length of the queue (amongst other things). If you have three pods and there're four messages in the queue, you could request the `/metrics` endpoints for each of them and expect:

```
# HELP messages Number of messages in the queue
# TYPE messages gauge
messages 4
```

You could leverage an HPA with a metric of type Pods to autoscale the workers.
Unfortunately, the _Pods_ metric for the HPA only does an average of value. And since all consumers expose the same value the average is the value exposed by each Pod — it's always four, independently of the number of pods. 
In other words, adding more Pods doesn't change the average value of the metric.
In this instance, the autoscaler will keep doubling the Pods until the metric is under the threshold. The number of Pods is not scaled proportionally with the size of the queue.

The other option is to use an HPA with a metric of type Object. Which is excellent because the metric computes a ratio between the target and the current value. So you could have the workers scale up linearly with the size of the queue. Unfortunately, the Object type cannot be applied to Pods that are created by a Deployment (or ReplicaSet). And from an engineering perspective, I need _someone_ to look after my Pods when they die. So HPA with Object is not an option.

Long story short.

1. I'd like to scale my workers based on the number of messages in the queue
1. the number of workers should be proportional to the number of messages
1. I'd like to expose the size of the queue as a custom metric from a Pod
1. I'm not allowed to have lonely Pods — Pods have to be wrapped in Deployments or RSs

As an example, if I defined a ratio of 10 messages for Pod and there're 72 messages in the queue, I'd expect the HPA to settle the number of replicas to 7.

As far as I understand, none of the current solutions allows me to do that. I'd like to put forward a proposal to do that.",open,False,2018-06-03 18:05:49,2019-02-08 17:24:08

Expand Kubernetes garbage collection to handle common uses which are awkward today. We will add an object-lifecycle-respecting TTL mechanism to the garbage collector. We will also allow users to mark resource objects to be cleaned up by the garbage collector after those objects are no longer in use: either terminated, completed, or not referenced by other resource objects. 

This KEP covers existing problems and an overview of a proposed solution. Implementation details are discussed separately (also linked in KEP):
1. Object-lifecycle-respecting TTL mechanism: https://goo.gl/9AUQ3n
2. Garbage collect resources that finish execution: https://goo.gl/ws9t3b
3. Garbage collect resources that are not used by other resources: https://goo.gl/KeHPiQ

_On each of your machines, install Docker. Version 17.03 is recommended, but 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 are known to work as well. Versions 17.06+ might work, but have not yet been tested and verified by the Kubernetes node team. Keep track of the latest verified Docker version in the Kubernetes release notes._

Since version 17.03 (last stable release was made in 2017-03-27) other stable versions have been released and the latest is 18.03.1 for the community edition (release date: 2018-04-26).
Also Docker has stable releases planned each quarter according to their release page (https://docs.docker.com/install/), but in some cases they seem to make intermediate releases.
So the version from the documentation is more than 1 year old. Also quite soon a new stable version should be released for this quarter.

Is somebody going to run some tests before the documentation is changed to the latest version?
If no can I propose an update for the latest version in the link from above?

Also what do you think about installing the latest stable version available at the time of the install for kubeadm?
This is the recommended installation for a CentOS/RHEL/Fedora environment, but not for the Ubuntu, Debian or HypriotOS.

Unfortunately, our Features tracking process (as it exists today), doesn't actively cull these issues.
I'm opening this issue up because I'd like to illicit some discussion around how we can eventually:
* ~deprecate this label~
* build a process around converting a `kind/feature` into a full-fledged Feature issue / KEP, which is actively tracked and PM-ed by both SIG PM and the relevant SIGs.

I know we've had some discussion around this particular problem, so I'm cc-ing a few people to jumpstart the convo.

community,jonasrosland,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2325,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2325,Non-Code Contributor Guide addition,"Currently the contributor guide is focused on how to contribute to Kubernetes by writing and submitting code. There are many other ways to contribute to an open source project though, and we want to make it easy for all contributors to do so.

The intent of the work done for the Non-Code Contributor Guide is to make Kubernetes a welcoming project for individuals with a vast array of different skillsets, and make it easy to find information on how they can collaborate on and improve the project.

Some examples of roles and skills that can propel the project forward include:

- Technical project leadership
  - Such as being a part of a SIG
- Leading contributor communities
  - Helping out in local Kubernetes communities, mentorship programs etc
- Recognition of people and projects
  - Making sure people are recognized for their hard work
- Managing communication tools
  - Zoom, Slack, Discourse, ...
- Writing articles/blogs
- Creating artwork
  - Maybe for different parts of the project, or aligned projects, or conferences
- Answering questions from community members
  - On Slack, discuss.k8s.io
- Updating documentation
  - Get specific enough so that someone would have an entrypoint to get started and take ownership
  - Funneling more people to SIG-Docs, everyone wins!
- Operations or aligned technologies that is generally not considered “dev”
  - Automation, monitoring, security hardening tools
- Onboarding and enabling new people
  - You only get one chance to see this onboarding process for the first time, so a steady stream a fresh eyes is important

https://youtu.be/sZekfvgIx28?list=WL&t=2076

me and @BenTheElder had a discussion about this today on slack:
https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C2C40FMNF/p1530819530000300
RAW copy-pasta of the discussion:
https://gist.github.com/neolit123/00835a9eec63de997329f0edf83977f6

also @dims proposed this tutorial about writing an Slack app.
https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial

The idea here is that sig-release need a tool to be able to find the email and/or slack handle of a user that submitted a PR, in case they need to directly contact said user about a certain PR related action.

one potential way of doing this is over a ""slack-app"", which is like a bot, except it has more power of what it can do. querying the slack app in the lines of `give-me-email-and-slack-of <github-handle>` or `give-me-details-about-this-pr <PR#>` would supposedly result into the app cloning the github repo and extracting email details for this committer. then it would also try to match the email used for the commit to the email used for the slack registration.

one big pitfall here is if the user has decided to set a dummy email in his `git config user.email`, which is not that uncommon.

right now, one reliable but manual way of finding the email of a member is by going here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/kubernetes-membership

searching for a github handle or a individual name and clicking over a user email and saying ""i'm not a robot"". 

as suggested by Ben, i'm opening this is issue in `k/community` for a discussion about the options we have. possibly the implementation itself would go in `k/test-infra`.

community,cblecker,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2367,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2367,Proposal: GitHub Management Subproject in Contributor Experience,"## History:
The Kubernetes project uses Github extensively to store and organize code, manage issues and documentation, and provide a consistent contributor flow.

With the size and growth of the Kubernetes project, management of our Github footprint has historically been a challenge.  Management and permissions are handled in an ad-hoc way.

## Proposal:
I'd like to propose a subproject under Contributor Experience to handle and manage GitHub settings, permissions, security, and process.

This subproject will be responsible for:
- Establishing policies, standards, and procedures for routine GitHub management tasks, including but not limited to: org membership, org permissions, repo creation/administration
- Establishing a policy around ""Org Owner"" permissions, and grant/limit these privileges accordingly
- Establishing policies and best practices for bot accounts, service accounts, webooks, and third-party integrations
- Maintaining documentation related to the above
- Establishing a ""GitHub Administration team"" that will oversee the execution of GitHub management tasks (inviting new members to the org, creating repos, executing moderation decisions, auditing permissions)
- Working with other sigs and interested parties in the project to execute GitHub tasks where required

This subproject will explicitly not be responsible for:
- Tooling and automation for GitHub (this falls under sig-testing, and the sig-contributor-experience Contributor Workflow and Automation subproject)
- Determining policies around which repos can get created (this falls under sig-architecture and the steering committee)
- Moderation policies and escalations on GitHub (this falls under the Moderation subproject, the Code of Conduct committee, and the steering committee)
- Contributor workflow within Kubernetes repos, e.g. mandated use of labels (this falls under the guise of the subproject responsible for the repo, and the Contributor Workflow and Automation subproject)",closed,False,2018-07-11 21:49:25,2018-07-23 21:21:21

community,quasoft,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2404,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2404,Mention possibility to use -v flag when running godep-restore.sh,"The documentation at [godep.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/godep.md) explains the use of the `hack/run-in-gopath.sh hack/godep-restore.sh` command for restoring dependencies.

This is fine, but the `hack/run-in-gopath.sh hack/godep-restore.sh` command shows no progress information and often takes a lot of time.

So it's good to mention that if you want to see what is happening, you can use the `-v` flag to turn on the verbose mode of `godep restore`.

This pull request is about adding a sentence at the end of section [Restoring deps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/godep.md) explaining the possible use of the `-v` flag.

community,cabrinoob,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2405,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2405,EKS and tag k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label is not assigned to worker nodes,"Hi,
I'am using an EKS cluster and I'd like to use cluster-autoscaler with it.

cluster-autoscaler version : 1.2.2
EKS kubernetes version : 1.10

So I have a brand new EKS cluster (with existing nodes) and I'd like to add new worker nodes with the CloudFormation script (as explained [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html)).

This script provided 3 new t2.small EC2 into an auto-scaling group. Because I'd like to use nodeSelector, I have tagged the ASG as explained [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md#scaling-a-node-group-to-0) : 

_If you are using nodeSelector you need to tag the ASG with a node-template key ""k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/""_

In my AWS console I see my tag on my ASGlike that : 

![tag](https://i.imgur.com/wzZltrG.png)

So, my problem is that I see news nodes in kubernetes, but the tag _k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/project_ has not been assigned to the labels of these nodes .... I don't know what I have missed.

The only tags I see are : 

```
Labels:         beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64
                    beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=t2.small
                    beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=us-east-1
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1c
                    kubernetes.io/hostname=ip-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ec2.internal
```

Here is the launch command of the cluster-autoscaler pod : 
```json
""command"": [
              ""./cluster-autoscaler"",
              ""--v=4"",
              ""--stderrthreshold=info"",
              ""--cloud-provider=aws"",
              ""--skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false"",
              ""--nodes=1:3:at-eks-worker-nodes-asg2-NodeGroup-1QOBK4RZ42IZI""
            ]
```
What I've missed?

community,cblecker,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2465,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2465,Auditing Kubernetes Org Owner Permissions,"**TL;DR**: We will soon be limiting org admin access to our GitHub administration team. If you do not have/need admin access to a kubernetes org, you may stop reading now.

---

Hello everyone,
With the size of the Kubernetes project and our GitHub footprint, Contributor Experience has created a dedicated team (@kubernetes/owners) to oversee and handle the day-to-day administration of GitHub. You can find more details on this team and our scope [here](https://git.k8s.io/community/github-management/README.md#github-administration-team).

Now that this team is established and in place, we are moving forward with auditing Org Owner permissions across all our active organizations and removing those who are not a part of this team. If you are on one of the lists below, your org owner access is slated to be removed on Wednesday, August 8th in the morning Pacific Time.

We are doing this to reduce our footprint of users/tokens that have ""root"" permissions on our orgs/repos, but retain a small, active team that is able to respond across time zones to take action when needed. This is something we have been working on for a while, but I accelerated my focus on it after the recent Gentoo GitHub security incident (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Infrastructure/Incident_Reports/2018-06-28_Github).

There may be some short-term issues once your access has been revoked. In particular, actions you previously were able to do (such as having direct write access to a repo) may not work after this access is removed. If any issues like this arise, please ping @kubernetes/owners or open an issue against the https://github.com/kubernetes/org repo, and we should be able to get you fixed up and added to the right teams.

Thank you for your understanding and patience during this transition!

Contribex has begun making small improvements that are low hanging fruit but in order to make larger more impactful change we need the following to continue:
 
1- Identify [current state / inventory of all communication and collaboration platforms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pmlj5nN_QJ3rRlc-HKOLfRdYY5qCWPMjnNPAdZZ22tg/edit?usp=sharing)
This includes all platforms listed on communication.md and others. This will identify owners, audience/reach, engagement, etc. Also, will identify collaboration platforms and owners of calendar invites from sig meetings, etc. so we can potentially centralize those services.

2- [Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8op9D-qjNczDiFHIS01-2kDxyiLJHPB3qzW889f-W0/edit?usp=sharing) contributors to see what is working and what isn't for them according to their preferences. Granted we will not be able to appease everyone and meet them where they are but we can identify trends and problematic spaces for us. 

From there, we can formally identify the gaps, research solutions, and make decisions. I'll continue to set issues to break down the work and will close this issue after the inventory and survey are complete. 

The above docs can be accessed if you are a member of the contributor experience mailing list. They are work in progress and would very much appreciate comments/contributions.

It also looks like these are all inter-related, so maybe they fall under a single subproject instead of a subproject per-repo. eg: [sig-api-machinery's kubernetes-clients subproject](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sigs.yaml#L95-L108)

The discuss KEP #2011  may have definitions of some of the details and features discussed below if you need more info. 

**Current challenges:**
a recent uptick in spam messages to kubernetes-users@googlegroups.com (among others) has lead us to moderate (approve them first) messages from all new members on the kubernetes-users@googlegroups.com mailing list. This is not scalable. 

users and contributors alike are experiencing communication platform overload. discuss and k-users are both covering user topics among many other locations. 

Proposing that we archive the k-users@ group which would mean that no new messages can be received and no new members. A message with historical context and new instructions for user discussion (discuss.k8s) will be added to the about page. We will give a 30-day notice of archival. There will also be a marketing campaign kick off to promote discuss.k8s (blog post, tweets, community site, etc.)  

**Pros**

- If this fails miserably, we can go back to the ml/gg. It will be archived and not deleted which will retain the data and we can return if necessary.
- discuss.k8s provides a community moderation feature that still has a core group of moderators but gives the community power to help out when a post is not appropriate. (askimet and a user-trust system)
- we can integrate the user discussion into the k8s.io website where they are there already for docs
- a nice branded experience for the user that will be similar to k8s.io
- more category organization around topics which can help with emails/asks of the same variety
- discuss.k8s has acquired 1000 users in 3 months (k-users@ has 3.6k over it's lifetime). with this trajectory and move, we could go past the mailing list number in 6-12 mos. 
- there is a custom word block feature that will let us upload words that are inappropriate. if there is a false positive, the user can reach out to an admin
- when users sign up they can opt in to just use ""kubernetes+general-discussions@discoursemail.com"" in their mail program to interact fully via the mail interface. 

**Cons**

- we run the risk of not converting members from k-users ml to discuss.k8s as does any change of platforms
- some users may prefer the UI of gg to discuss.k8s


**Suggested next steps:**

- [x] email k-users@ with our intentions after discussion with issue link leaving 5 days to voice their concerns (with contribex ml cc'ed)
- [x] target ~August 20th as official notice of archival with date set for 30 days later.

- [x] send bulk email invite to discuss to the mailing list users for an opt-in service

- [x] kick off marketing campaign

- [x] archive on ~Sept 20th

FYI @kubernetes/owners @kubernetes/sig-contributor-experience-misc-use-only-as-a-last-resort

The [currently documented way of becoming a kubernetes org member](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#member) is to e-mail kubernetes-membership@googlegroups.com

We want to replace this with interaction with the kubernetes/org repo.  We have an [issue template for this](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/new?template=membership.md).  We're also working on a PR-based process backed by automation.

How should we proceed?
1. update docs to use the issue template for now, wait until automation is ready, update docs to use a PR process that is fully automated
2. wait until automation is ready, update docs to use a PR process that is fully automated
3. update docs to use a PR process, have github admin team members manually implement what automation would do, turn on automation when ready

Some minor changes to the initial KEP after further discussions in the sig-api-machinery Slack channel.
Builds on top of https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2354 and marks it as `implementable`.
We have now submitted and merged the ~5 first PRs of this effort, with more PRs planned and in the reviewing stage. We hope to get all of this implemented by v1.12 code freeze.

The additions to this version is that we've decided on a defaulting story, and know a bit more about the actual implementation plan, and know what tests to write up for the MVP.

I submit this proposal because the generic Initializer is planned to be deprecated, however the mechanism is very useful for _container_ resources like namespace, and I hope we can keep this mechanism, at least specialize it and move it towards beta/GA. If the generic Initializer will move on to beta/GA, I will abandon this proposal.

Note: this proposal requires changes in core Kubernetes, and adding a new field in stable API object.

suggesting a move of the kubernetes/utils subproject to sig-arch

I also think sig-arch should own deciding where to move code that
currently lives in k/contrib. This is the last repo not yet included in
sigs.yaml (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2464)

I have added each of these as their own subprojects. Another approach
could be to make a ""code-organization"" subproject, and place both of
these repos under that

community,sgnn7,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2554,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2554,`k8s.io/code-generator` scripts do not work from repos that use new Go modules,"When invoking [generate-groups.sh](https://github.com/sgnn7/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator/generate-groups.sh) from a repo that uses the new [Golang v1.11 modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), none of the codegens work as they assume that the repo layout has the code in `$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/code-generator` and that dependencies have been downloaded for this project (not doable using `go mod` easily).

Steps to reproduce:
```
$ docker run -it --rm golang:1.11rc1 /bin/bash
root@5f5497fb59c9:/go# mkdir /foo && cd /foo && go mod init foo
go: creating new go.mod: module foo

root@5f5497fb59c9:/foo# go get -u k8s.io/code-generator
go: finding k8s.io/code-generator latest
go: downloading k8s.io/code-generator v0.0.0-20180806210827-caff7734d7c0

root@5f5497fb59c9:/foo# find / -name 'generate-groups.sh'
/go/pkg/mod/k8s.io/code-generator@v0.0.0-20180806210827-caff7734d7c0/generate-groups.sh

root@5f5497fb59c9:/foo# /go/pkg/mod/k8s.io/code-generator@v0.0.0-20180806210827-caff7734d7c0/generate-groups.sh all foo foo bar
bash: /go/pkg/mod/k8s.io/code-generator@v0.0.0-20180806210827-caff7734d7c0/generate-groups.sh: Permission denied
```

Changing the executable flag doesn't help as the script [goes into that directory and runs `go install`](https://github.com/sgnn7/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/code-generator/generate-groups.sh#L53)  which in this case cannot complete due to this module not having installable dependencies with `go mod`:
```

It seems that this can get further (until full go modules support) by adding a `go.mod` to the base of this repo and making the script executable but even then, the pathing is broken in [these](https://github.com/kubernetes/code-generator/blob/master/cmd/deepcopy-gen/main.go#L63):

Is there a document describing the build / dev process for API changes or something similiar?
I'm currently working on a bugfix for a k8s pkg bug. This fix requires an additional field in an API VolumeSource struct. However such a change seems to require additional conversion impls and does not correctly propagate through the different API layers (core, v1, etc.). I read the API conventions document [1] but so far i'm not grasping where exactly changes to the api have to be made and how to propagate them fully to the required generated classes.
I'm happy to get pointers to additional docs or other hints.
Thanks

A lot of the diagrams I'm making now are for [Helm Charts](https://github.com/helm/charts), which I co-maintain.

I'm not sure if these importable libraries are appropriate for the community repo, but I'm opening this PR for discussion about that. Perhaps they are?

This PR currently includes SVG libraries matching the iconset directories in this repo, as well as one for the [SVG Kubernetes logos](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/logo). 

The libraries are currently only for draw.io. I'm not able to do this with Lucidchart because of a [SVG import and Text object](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360014618646-SVG-import-and-Text-object) bug. We could export only the unlabeled icons for Lucidchart, or use PNGs for the labeled ones, but I didn't do that yet. Up for discussion.

We have an issue with AWS cert manager certificates “disappearing” from the a kubernetes service ELB (deis-router).
We currently see the problem in K8s 1.9 (we’ve upgraded 3/5 clusters to 1.10 now and not sure if I’ve seen the problem there yet) installed/upgraded with kops 1.9.1
The cert is on the deis-router kubernetes service, and the cert isn’t defined in the service description since I also change some ports so that 443 is pointing to what was defined as 80 on the pod (from the way deis workflow recommends to up the router: https://github.com/teamhephy/workflow/blob/master/src/managing-workflow/platform-ssl.md#installing-ssl-on-a-load-balancer).
Does anyone know why sometimes (not even every month), the AWS cert manager cert needs replacing on the k8s service elb?",closed,False,2018-09-09 19:22:13,2018-09-11 17:25:02

community,parispittman,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2657,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2657,1:1 hour mentoring process improvements,"After conducting some tests and a retro, we discovered the following that needs to be corrected before a full scale launch can happen.

**Automation**
if the coordinator or person setting up the event is sick, ooto, etc., it will block the entire process. Getting this automation right is P0 or coming up with a team of people to coordinate.

Ideal workflow: [for all of this to happen in GitHub with an issue or PR template with full automation] mentee applies via some kind of form, mentor is auto-matched with limited to no human involvement (based on criteria below in the 3rd bullet), calendar is sent with populated information, meeting happens, everyone is happy

- [ ] figure out an automated flow between mentor to collect calendar availability and mentee to select from that. the back and forth that just the scheduling process causes is a huge bus factor and time hole.

- [ ] need to generate a ""profile"" and hopefully populate it in the calendar invite on information from the mentee's form with critical info that the mentor will need pre-session.
Fields that need to be carried over:

_Mentee Info_ 

1. preferred name and pronouns, github id, slack id 
2. 1:1 hour activity choice 
3. $said_choice tools/misc 
4. dev enviro set up? 
5. exp with Go (if applicable) 
6. exp with the following (q about yaml, containers, our testing infra, etc.) 

_Mentor Info (for mentees as fyi)_

1. preferred name and pronouns, github id, slack id 
2. what sig/wg(s) are you most active in

- [ ] a light match. Mentors will be trained that they will not be a perfect match ever and that it's important to teach the mentee how to be resourceful and learn together. 
Match on the following mandatory criteria: 1) timezone - need to be within three hours 2) 1:1 hour activity choice 3) $said_choice tools/misc  4) level on contributor ladder (must be => mentees; equal is perfectly acceptable) 5) *optional match: what sig are you interested in getting more involved

**Process Improvement**
- [ ] identify three recommended tools/ways of doing remote pair programming that would work for our environment. 
why? the mentor and mentee took significant time from the one hour trying to decide on what tool would work best for them and then they didn't do the pair. if we establish this upfront, or at least boil down the countless ways and have folks agree to those, it will save much needed time here.

- [ ] need to finesse all of the activity use cases and make sure that mentors are set up for success so we don't have another pair programming tool debacle. ie - if it's not pair programming and say an AMA, we need to document to use zoom, hangouts, etc. Take this decision away from the mentor/mentees to free up their time to work on the hard stuff.

- [ ] pair programming: add documentation about the mentee responsibility to bring a help wanted labeled issue (preferred) or an concept to half complete PR. The mentor needs a jumping off point so there isn't a long amount of back and forth. 

- [ ] mentors need a script/instructions since this isn't your average mentoring session. definitely need a closing since it's only a one time session - how do you end the call? provide the mentee with other resources to check out, places to communicate, etc.

- [ ] learning / workshops / curriculum 
there is plenty of new contributor information now (workshop videos, contributor guide, etc.) where we don't need to concentrate on this one as P0. The need now is to create education for members+. we found this to be a challenge in our test group since each SIG/WG has a different onboarding process / ramp for knowledge. 
for the test, we did members who wanted to be reviewers and concentrated on the following general areas: 
live how to code review, how to review [better] docs, communicating with empathy, advanced testing/ci, general community/governance. 

what does this look like for reviewer->approver?

- [ ] take all of the learning opportunities that were padded into the bi weekly standups (mentioned above) and make them in the beginning of the cohort. some of the information was too useful for their journey to have at the end. figure out a schedule for this and how it would flow. 

- [ ] think about the slack mentoring groups structure. 
current state - private slack channel is created by cohort. 

should we create larger private groups for ""future reviewer"", ""future approver"" to capitalize on peer mentoring or is this redundant/another channel/not set a good precedence and direct everyone talk in k-dev? 
Pros of larger private groups for mentoring - people will want to ask more questions because the signal to noise ratio is smaller, will be ok publicly asking small questions and/or limit the ""sorry if im asking this but..."" that is heard often in learning situations. We can still keep the smaller cohort channels too? I could be overthinking this but I've noticed when the channel is bigger (but not huge - like that of #meet-our-contributors), everyone is sharing the burden to help out. 

- [ ] implement 'slack standups' weekly and bi-weekly video standups. also implement a better process of obtaining and picking a standup date/time that does not change. 
current state: bi weekly standups/workshops with dates/times that change so we can cater to a global cohort. as empathic as I am, that doesn't scale.

community,embano1,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2678,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/2678,Discussion and idea on improving multi-cloud abstraction,"/sig architecture
@mhausenblas and I were discussing the current challenges when developing portable multi-cloud applications on Kubernetes. We acknowledge that at the core this is a controversial discussion, but more and more multi-cloud frameworks, e.g. recently knative, leverage the power of cloud abstraction by Kubernetes to build even more sophisticated frameworks.

Thanks to the Kubernetes cloud provider interface there is a level of standardization which improves decoupling from the underlying cloud provider. However, there are implementation details which leak through. For example, some lower level K8s primitives (e.g. ""Volume"" or ""Ingress"") allow provider-specific customizations which make applications/frameworks less portable or at least their deployment and maintenance more complex and thus error-prone. This is also the reason why a good installation guide has deployment files and manuals for every cloud provider targeted. Also, the out-of-tree cloud provider migration might lead to a situation of even less compatibility between clouds as every cloud provider can move faster/ at is own pace and is free to implement any capability due to the improved decoupling from K8s core.

On the other hand, we see more and more cloud-native SDKs, such as [Go Cloud](https://github.com/google/go-cloud), [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) which try to abstract common building blocks from the major public cloud vendors, e.g. object storage, queues, etc. This supports the assumption that cross-cloud development has a fellowship.

@mhausenblas and I were wondering, whether there are attempts or discussions how to incorporate functionalities likes those in cloud SDKs natively into Kubernetes. knative is one approach, but as far as I understand it is designed solely with FaaS in mind. We think that any modern workload developed to run on Kubernetes could benefit from integrating common public cloud services, such as object storage, queues, etc. For example, instead of dealing with `PersistentVolumeClaims`, one would reference a `kind: ObjectStore` in the deployment spec which, depending on the cluster configuration, could leverage policies and configurations to be enabled for specific public cloud, e.g. AWS and GCP as an example. The application would use base CRUD operations against the storage object.

We understand that there is a need to reduce the number of API objects in K8s core and most of the extensions should be handled by CRDs or any other external extension mechanism. So if there is already a discussion or even development going on, it would be great to get some pointers.

Thanks for the feedback, ideas, and hopefully any pointers to work in that space.

There are the 4xx errors on the site. I have removed obvious note/meeting archives that don't need to be updated. 

As discussed in a contribex meeting, we'd like to group these in a way that new contributors can send in contributions, but we don't want one PR per broken link because that's too noisy, but we also don't want more than 5 fixes per PR because that's too chunky. 

We could do this multiple ways, like grouping them together and then adding them as individual issues? Or we could do it checklist style. Anyone have recommendations? 

We could probably run this once a quarter or something for maintenance.

We have #k8s-infra-team on slack

There is a recurring meeting with a running agenda doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0nydnBoU7o_L7Hnjdc9SZrWe9zosbz64ZUUPn0XwXk/edit

Discussion during the team's first meeting (I wasn't around for the second) was a recognition that this effort needs to be formalized, but we didn't want to impede its initial progress around such formalization

Ideas to consider:
- a ""subproject"" under a single SIG, ie: the ""release team"" is a subproject of SIG Release that involves effort from areas across the project
- a ""working group"", this spans the work of multiple sigs (contribex, testing, release)
- a ""team "" akin to the ""product security team"", which has more stringent requirements for membership and responsibilities
- a ""sig"" because this group could potentially own code/assets
- something that falls under CNCF's purview rather than Kubernetes (to my knowledge CNCF only has working groups)
- we would want to ensure rules are in place to ensure no single entity dominates leadership/ownership of this effort

Do you need more SIG members? Are there many outstanding Good First Issue and Help Wanted labels in your SIG’s projects? Are you running out of Reviewers in your OWNERS files? Will members of your SIG attend the Contributor Summit at KubeCon Seattle?

This is the opportunity for you and your SIG!

We need one or more of your members to volunteer 30 - 50 minutes of their time to meet interested new contributors in person. You'll find our their skills, how they can add value, and talk about a first issue they can try. If you've ever been to a Speed Networking session (KubeCon has them - plug!), it's very similar except you both have the same goal. You - to find more contributors; Them - to find a SIG to be a part of.

Requirements:

- Member of SIG***
- Available Monday Dec 10 at 3:00pm at KubeCon Contributor Summit Seattle
- Familiarize yourself with your SIG’s needs, and maybe a few good first issues
- Willingness to follow up and be available for questions by new folks.
- Add your name/contact information via comment to this github issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2745

***This person need NOT be a SIG Chair or Maintainer, just someone willing to be a friendly face, show folks around the repo via chat, and generally bridge the gap for new contributors from “this is where I want to contribute” to “here’s how I can contribute”. In fact, this might be an opportunity for other people in your SIG to grow.

phase.  Not sure how we got that through review.  Part of it may have
been the html table format.  To help with that, in addition to removing
the errant indication of milestone as required in that early period,
I've also added html comments in the table so the reader of the raw code
can more clearly see which section is which.

Basically I think the Graph of the Week slot has outlived its utility to the community.  We've shown all the graphs, but I don't know if people are using them.  I'd rather replace that 5min slot with something that shows people how to do stuff on our project, or a piece of our automation, etc.  I think this should be SIG Contribex's time to share whatever improvements we've made to the workflow, or whatever things are out there that people may not know about.

I'm also not sure if KEP of the Week is worth keeping around.  The last time we had one was August 30th.

It's a pain point for multi-zone clusters deployment since cross-zone network traffic being charged, while in-zone is not. In addition, cross-node traffic may carry sensitive metadata from other nodes. Therefore, users always prefer the service backends that close to them, e.g. same zone, rack and host etc. for security, performance and cost concerns.

Kubernetes scheduler can constraining a pod to only be able to run on particular nodes/zones. However, Kubernetes service proxy just randomly picks an available backend for service routing and this one can be very far from the user, so we need a topology-aware service routing solution in Kubernetes. Basically, to find the nearest service backend.

Currently much of the docs within the community repo do not follow a consistent set of rules with regard to tone and formatting. There are a few suggestions here or there such as the [Markdown link style guide](https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-contributor-experience/markdown-link-style-guide.md). However, forming a more comprehensive general style guide, say similar to the general [Kubernetes Docs Style Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/) would likely be quite beneficial, especially before the start of the [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/) project to revamp the Developer Guide.

Additionally, going back and updating the current content to conform to the established style guide would provide a series of 'good first issues' for new contributors. A part of this task could include fixing links or other minor issues that should hopefully cut down on the amount of [trivial pull request flooding](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2602).

```
Note the 3rd clusterRoleSelectors ""matchExpressions"" is wrong, but it shouldn't affect how the 1st and 2nd selectors work. However, it turns out the 3rd malformed clusterRoleSelector will prevent rules from `system:aggregate-to-view` (which matches the 2nd clusterRoleSelector) being added to the created cluster role.
If I remove the 3rd clusterRoleSelector then the created cluster role has both set of rules from 1st and 2nd clusterRoleSelectors.

Here we just look at how to identify folks who are not very active and request seconds/alternates to add to OWNERS files, so PR(s) do not go stale. Making sure we add more active folks to OWNERS will help reduce burden on existing folks as well.

Find out who are listed in the OWNERS files and how many files does their id appear: (we should probably write a python script that does this better!)
`find . -name OWNERS -exec grep ""\- "" {} \; | grep -v ""sig/"" | grep -v ""sig-"" | grep -v ""area/"" | cut -f 1 -d '#' | cut -f 2 -d '-' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head -50`

Then I took the devstats dash board specifically the developer activity count for last year and the number of references in OWNERS files to those folks. We can download the CSV using the ""Export CSV"" option. The contents of this CSV is in the ""Sheet 2""

See Sheet 1 for list of folks with the number of times they show up in owners files and the data about their developer activity.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I6s-5Lq7Sp0ZPaqUE__ALRp7SdUDVBgC-_OuVX57-lQ/edit#gid=978045923

So now that we know we can grab some data like this. what do we do next?

- We need to do this exercise every release cycle
- We need to figure out who we need to target to ping about updating OWNERS files with additional help (and they may choose to leave themselves in or out for sure)
- We could run this by sig leads to see if they spot someone who are no longer active?
- Who should be reaching out to these folks? (A quick poll in steering indicated that we should do this kind of exercise as part of sig-contribex)
- What kind of message should be sent to those who are no longer active? 

Do we want to do this? Do we try this once and write down the process so it can be repeated?

This is an audit mainly for suitability and correctness of the owners.  We want to ensure that these people are considered suitable by the community to do reviews or approve PRs.  Presumably it means they are knowledgeable in the area, have shown good judgement, and are in good standing and at the appropriate level on the contributor ladder.  It's not about PR review latency.  That is the focus of #2873.

I don't think *this* process can be fully automated, because there's nothing quantitative that definitively shows whether or not person X is a good or bad choice.  Examples: they may have written or reviewed a lot of PRs in the past year in this area, but have just transferred to a new project; they may have done no reviews in this area, but there may also be no change in this area; the project may be brand new, the person may be a co-owner, but so far there's not enough volume to show that they ""contribute"" in the area.

Given those requirements: (1) audit for correctness, (2) difficult (at best) to automate, I propose we simply ask owners to review owners.

Proposal

0. (Base case) Begin with an owner from the root OWNERS file.
1. This owner will audit the OWNERS file in question, making additions or removals as appropriate.
2. (Induction step) This owner will, for each subdirectory, choose an owner whom they trust from *that* OWNERS file to begin the process from step 1.
3. At each stage, the chosen owner from the parent directory is expected to review and understand the justification for all changes, and to generally come to consensus with the sub-reviewer about the content of their file.
4. In the base case, we could choose an alternate root owner to act as the reviewer.  Or all other root owners or a quorum of root owners.

(This is spun out of #2873.  We want to focus #2873 on making sure we have good review latency.  That might mean adding reviewers or tweaking the weights for auto-assignment or other things, but it's explicitly not about making sure that we have the right people in the right OWNERS file.)

The Kubernetes page on the Outreachy website can be found [here](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/kubernetes/).

**List of things that need to be done:**

- [x] Send an [email to the kubernetes-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/kubernetes-dev/wrbjJD9_vQo/discussion) for a Call for mentors, projects and sponsor organizations.
- [x] Figure out sponsors for Outreachy interns.
  - CNCF is sponsoring 2 interns and Google is sponsoring 1 intern.
- [x] Sign up Kubernetes as a community/org on the Outreachy website.
  - @parispittman and @nikhita are coordinators for Kubernetes.
- [x] Add projects and sign up mentors on the Outreachy website.
  - ""Adding advanced features to Kubernetes client libraries"" mentored by @brendandburns 
  - ""Improve the integration of Kubernetes client libraries with existing language documentation"" mentored by @brendandburns 
  - ""Revamp Kubernetes Developer Guide"" mentored by @parispittman 
- [x] Create a channel on slack to help all Outreachy applicants with getting started, answering questions, etc.
  - Created the #outreachy-apps channel on Slack.
- [x] Help applicants with their application and make sure that all applicants have submitted their application on the Outreachy website by November 6.
- [x] Work with mentors to select interns.
- [x] Announcement of results on November 16.
  - @eduartua will be working on the dev guide :tada: 
  - Unfortunately, applicants to other projects were ineligible as per Outreachy.

We will consider this issue closed once all interns have been selected and announced.

This issue is for discussing how to handle a flood of trivial PRs for reviewers, approvers and members.

---

We have recently noticed a flood of trivial (typos, removal of repeated words, punctuation) PRs in many repos. This situation has been discussed in the #sig-contribex channel on Slack and this issue captures some of the discussion.

**Current Situation**:

_What the problem is NOT about_: New/new-ish contributors submitting PRs with trivial changes. It is absolutely fine to start with something small so that they can learn the process.

_What the problem is about_:

- Trivial changes are being sent as separate PRs by the same author instead of being batched into a single PR.
- There is at least one new PR each day with a trivial fix.
- Some authors are only creating trivial PRs across several repos in the @kubernetes org.
- If a reviewer suggested changes to a (trivial) PR, the author simply files a new PR and tries to assign to someone else, sometimes even to people who are not in the relevant OWNERS files.

**Problems to reviewers**:

- Reviewers feel overwhelmed at the sheer volume of such PRs.
- It affects reviewer bandwidth and makes it harder for them to tackle non-trivial PRs.
- Leads to lots of noise to the PR queue.
- Creating new PRs while disregarding the changes requested on the old PR leads to frustration amongst reviewers.

**Possible motivations for creating such PRs**:

- To game the number of contributions in [devstats](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/) and [stackanalytics](http://stackalytics.com/?project_type=kubernetes-group&metric=commits). Gaming the numbers in devstats could lead to a higher individual/company ranking.
- We noticed a sudden spike in such PRs when it was announced that eligible voters for the Steering Committee elections [require at least 50 contributions in devstats](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/master/elections.md#elegibility-for-voting). It is possible that people wanted to qualify as a voter and started creating trivial PRs.
- To [ gain org membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2602) by having more number of PRs under their belt.

**Possible Solutions**:

We already have [documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#10-trivial-edits) for authors submitting trivial changes. Some more solutions for reviewers discussed on Slack:

- `/hold`ing PRs which tackle only few (one or two) trivial changes so that the author can add some more changes to the PR before merging.
   - Suggestion on how to do this (can be with/without holding): ""Thank you, we really appreciate your contribution. It looks like you're great at this, would you mind going over the entire document and see if there are other things that needs fixing as well?""
- Point authors to `good first issue`s by explicitly (and politely) asking authors if they would like to tackle them.
  - Suggestion on how to do this: ""I've noticed you've submitted a few of these and probably now understand how the process works. Would you mind looking over this policy here and start working on larger commits? We like to see people grow as they contribute and we think you're ready to take on more complex tasks"".

**Automation**:

- While we _do_ have [automation in place](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/verify-spelling.sh) for catching typos, the library used for spell-check (`misspell`) is lacking and does not catch lots of mistakes.
- We don't have automation in place for catching repeated word typos. It is somewhat possible manually by https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2898#issuecomment-435686111 but the approach is not automation-friendly.

xref https://groups.google.com/d/topic/kubernetes-sig-docs/aapjkJ8gD1c/discussion - This problem was also discussed on the sig-docs mailing list last year.

SIGs/WGs no longer need licenses, especially if they don't want one, as we can centralize this service. Right now, we are asking 70+ people to understand how to administratively set up a lot of security details when they should focus on running the meeting and that's it. The best practices doc is 10+ pages of admin details. 

Organizers will still need to turn off the screen sharing in meeting settings as the only roll over responsibility. Zoom is working on making this a global setting vs individual.

Phase 1  - Before EOY
All SIGs/WGs that are still using their personal meeting ID from #2536 will have a new meeting created under our global account. This will generate a new zoom link in which will need to be updated. 

Phase 2 - Q1 2019
All SIGs/WGs organizers who no longer want to be responsible for a license can fold into the new structure

Phase 3 - Q1 2019

I have implemented a CronHPA which enables us to scale workloads(those support scale subresource) periodically using crontab scheme.

## Use cases
A lot of game player will play games from Friday evening to Sunday evening. It will be better to provide a better experience for players if game servers(pods) could be scaled to a lager size at Friday evening and scaled to normal size at Sunday evening. And that's what game server admins do every week.

Some other customers also do similar things because their products' usage also have peaks and valleys periodically. CronHPA is for their requirement.

## CronHPA example:
```
---
apiVersion: gs.io/v1alpha1
kind: CronHPA
metadata:
  name: example-cron-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    name: demo-deployment
  crons:
    - schedule: ""0 23 * * 5""  // Set replicas to 60 every Friday 23:00
      targetReplicas: 60
    - schedule: ""0 23 * * 7""  // Set replicas to 30 every Sunday 23:00
      targetReplicas: 30

---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-deployment
  labels:

tl;dr - we are getting a small working group together (no, not official kubernetes working group on the sigs list) of folks who want to help out with a content strategy for the contributor site. Is this you?

Current state -
[KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-contributor-experience/0005-contributor-site.md) that is being reworked; we know that the site needs to display KEPs and events - that's a given. 
However, current KEP lists that we should surface docs from the community repo but doesn't include what-where-how-etc. After the initial development, we realized that not all of this needs to be surfaced, docs need work, and/or needs to be shaped as web content vs technical documentation (example: a blurb about our governance with a link to our entire governance doc set vs the showing the entire governance doc set). 

This content strategy piece will help us determine what content is most important, how it should be laid out, and the information goals for the site. Current team: @castrojo @mattfarina + me. Looking for ~2 more to do the following activities:
-we have lots of survey data - let's dig in and use it

Indeed, I don't know of a database (something like https://ossindex.sonatype.org/) for go libraries that we could use. (perhaps the CNCF can help here...)

But the lack of tools and databases isn't an excuse.

We need to do a better job here of tracking, reporting and updating our dependencies to fix known relevant security issues.

And ultimately, we also need to do a periodic audit to make sure that we aren't importing vulnerabilities into the codebase.

Currently, Kubernetes (and EKS) doesn't support EFS mounting using **amazon-efs-utils** package. The only way to connect to EFS is using NFS Persistent Volume. In this way, the advances of EFS cannot be used, such as TLS connection.

**It would be great if AWS can contribute an EFS CSI Driver for Kubernetes.**

Failed to mount a local-storage volume. (stateful-set with PVC + PV + local-storage class)
First PV is at ""Bound"" status with correct PVC, but deployment never ends.
Kubelet log say:  lstat /mongo/data: no such file or directory
But /mongo/data exists on the hosts.

**What you expected to happen**:
Volume should be successfully mounted.

**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:
Create storage class:
```

metadata:
  name: local-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
reclaimPolicy: Retain
```

Create 3 PVs:
```

  name: mongo-[one/two/three]
spec:
  capacity:

          operator: In
          values:
          - [one/two/three]
```

Create a stateful-set with 3 replicas and a PVC: (mongo-replicaset helm chart 3.8.0)
```
...
  volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data/db
      name: datadir

      storageClassName: local-storage
      resources:
        requests:

...
```

**Anything else we need to know?**:

community,sun7927,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3036,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/3036,Flexvolume volume resizing feature doesn't work,"/sig storage

**what happened**
Setup a one-node Kubernetes 1.13 cluster and installed with a plugin with volume provisioner and flexvolume for an external block storage. It worked correctly and successfully to create a PVC and a Pod using it. However, it went in a problem when expanding the PVC, that the flexvolume plugin didn't get ```expandfs``` call.

**what is expected to happen**
When expand a PVC, the status goes into ```FileSystemResizePending```. And then, re-create (delete and then create again) the POD which is using the PVC, the flexvolume should get the ```expandfs``` call.

Environment:
**Kubernetes Cluster**
One node cluster, installed 1.13 version by kubeadm;

**flexvolume plugin**
1. storageclass
```
allowVolumeExpansion: true
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: ""false""
  creationTimestamp: 2018-12-04T22:54:36Z
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/cluster-service: ""true""
  name: mystorage
  resourceVersion: ""2659""
  selfLink: /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/storageclasses/mystorage
  uid: 9296d77b-f817-11e8-9140-aa00c780d2c6
parameters:
  backend: block
provisioner: mystorage-provisioner
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```
2. flexvolume plugin
Implemented the following APIs for volume resizing:
```
expandvolume
expandfs
```
In addition, the flexvolume is installed on the host, and working correctly for volume mount/unmount/attach/detach.

**The PVC/Pod info**
``` PVC:
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  # Referenced in pod.yaml for the volume spec
  name: mypvc-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: mystorage
```
```Pod:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  # Specify a volume that uses the claim defined in pvc.yaml
  volumes:
  - name: my-vol
    persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc-claim
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    # Configure a mount for the volume We define above
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-vol
      mountPath: /data
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

After creating PVC and Pod successfully, resized the volume like:
```kubectl edit pvc mypvc-claim```, changed the ```resources.requests.storage``` from ```5G``` to ```8G```
And then, the PVC status is changed
```

And then, deleted the pod which also called flexvolume plugin to unmount/detach the PVC/volume successfully. And later, created another pod which called flexvolume plugin to attach/mount the PVC successfully.
However, it didn't send out expandfs call the flexvolume plugin for resizing filesystem.

I am debugging certain behavior from my application pods; i am launching on K8s cluster. In order to do that I am increasing logging by increasing verbosity of deployment by adding ` --v=N ` flag to` Kubectl create deployment ` command.

my question is : how can i configure increased verbosity globally so all pods start reporting increased verbosity; including pods in kube-system name space.

i would prefer if it can be done without re-starting k8s cluster; but if there is no other way I can re-start.

community,eduartua,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3064,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/3064,Umbrella issue - Revamping the Kubernetes Developer’s guide,"The contributor guide has been revamped. This is a mostly general guide for all who are getting ramped up on Kubernetes upstream contributions. We need to produce a section of that with the name “The developer guide”

As per [#1919](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/1919) and [#892](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/892), and the content within the /devel folder, we have to decide a structure for the developer guide. It has to be in a way that new developers find it intuitive and well organized.

### Primary goals:
- Have an inventory of everything inside the /devel folder.
- Update and clean up of /devel, some files have to be updated, moved or just deleted.
- Create a skeleton.
- Develope in a logical manner every skeleton point.

This issue is an umbrella tracking issue.

### Skeleton draft
We are going to build this thinking of two personas:

1. Developers that want to contribute to the code base (kubernetes/kubernetes).
2. Developers that want to build apps over top of k8s.

This initial work will be focused on the understanding of the internals required by **persona 1**. It is important to have a sense of how they come together to form a functional cluster and how that is used.

As a new developer, the following are the things I would like to read first in order to become familiar with the project:

1. **Prerequisites**

- Setting the dev environment - There is information about this but my feeling the first time I read it was that something was missing, something like a small example or tutorial testing dev tools after installation.
  1. Golang dev environment
  2. Keeping your golang install up to date
  3. Specify the software required with versions (e.g etdc version)

- Getting the code (git workflow)
  1. fork k8s repo on github
  2. where to put your k8s repo locally
  3. Environment variables to set
- Concepts to which you must have familiarity and sources.

2. **Communication channels**
Where to ask for help or orientation - We have this in the contributing guide. SIGs, repos, mailing lists, IM/chat, meetings

3. **Quick reference**
Here are the basic steps needed to get set up and contribute.

4. **Status of Kubernetes branches**
A table with information like branch’s name, status about the kinds of contributions it accepts. Example: release branches that are N-3 only allow bug fixes, feature branches are used for feature work to be merged into master later, etc.

5. **Code of Conduct**

Both Persona 1 and 2 have in common the previous points. 

Specific points for each persona:
### Persona 1 (Code Contributor)

### To help out
1. The first thing we need to create is a definitive skeleton or toc. If you are part of a SIG that has valuable information regards the developer's guide, It is very helpful to make proposals to the points mentioned above.
2. If you know a file is outdated or lacks information, please comment here.
3. Ping me or this issue so I can update it with changes.
4. In case you are helping to re-write, move, and/or remove a linked reference, make a PR pointing out if it is finished or it is in partial completion, and finally referring to this issue.
5. Lastly, all files used to build this guide will live in community/contributors/devel/guide.

### Files to review
Files in the contributors/devel need to be scrubbed for the developer guide.  Non-developer relevant topics should be moved over to other parts of the contributor repo or just be deleted. There might be some calls to make.

**Check for:**

Duplicate content that can be removed.
Might not be appropriate for the developer guide.
Might need to be deleted or combined with another document.
Might be blocked on waiting on another part of the contributor guide to be finished.
(Thanks to Guin here)

### Pages to update
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/README.md
### Folders to update
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel

### Inventory

- [x] **adding-an-APIGroup.md** - referes to api_changes.md, so references to this files has to be changed to api_changes.md and finally removed.
- [x] **api_changes.md** - Should be part of developer guide (Point 1.a)
- [x] **api-conventions.md** - This is going to be part of the developer guide, I think we must segment the information oriented towards either the core devs or platform devs.
- [x] **architectural-roadmap.md** - This  will be part of the developer guide, revision in progress.
- [x] **arch-roadmap-1.png**
- [x] **Automation.md** - This document has to be part of k/test-infra - it won’t be part of the developer guide.
- [x] **bazel.md** - The default build process is using kubernetes development helper scripts - is going Bazel to become default?
- [x] **cherry-picks.md** - Should be part of the guide, but where? - move to https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/release-process-documentation
- [x] **client-libraries.md** - filed moved to docs (to be deleted from /devel).
- [x] **collab.md** - Talks about collaborative development. (To remove)
- [x] **component-config-conventions.md** - This doc serves as a design guideline for component configurations. We can reference this document in the main content of the developer guide.
- [x] **conformance-tests.md**  - This document has testing information that can be integrated into the guide.
- [x] **container-runtime-interface.md**  -  It has to be part of the guide.

- add boksos, gopherage, gubernator and prow to

- move sig-testing's ""repo-publishing"" to sig-release
  as ""publishing-bot""
- rename sig-release's ""release"" to ""release-team"" and
  add the release-team/OWNERS to owners
- add descriptions to sig-release subprojects

I did the SIG Release stuff while I was there, I can punt that if it's
too scope creepy. Main thing was I looked back and publishing-bot was
added in by someone from API Machinery. Neither of the people listed as
approvers for that codebase have ever attended SIG Testing. It seems
more like up SIG Release's alley than having anything to do with
Testing.

I chose the SIG Testing subprojects based on those= which seemed like they
could conceivably be extracted into their own repos if we someday wanted to.

There are others which I might want to group together and I didn't feel
like getting mired in that right now (ie: project config sorta spans
config, jobs, testgrid; github automation spans robots, maintenance,
some prow/cmd subdirs, etc.)

NOTE: I'm not actually sure an umbrella issue makes sense here. I'm creating one so I have something to link to from the [1.13 Retro](https://bit.ly/k8s113-retro)

>Break issues out of Deflaking notes and file them in the appropriate repos

We had a session on deflaking e2e tests at the Kubecon Seattle Contributors Summit.  We also had an impromptu meeting later at Kubecon Seattle.  I rambled a lot, let's see if we can convert into actionable issues.

Some random high level thoughts on organization:
- I added an `area/deflake` label (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/10624) so if nothing else, you can use an [`org:kubernetes label:area/deflake` github query](https://github.com/issues?q=org%3Akubernetes+label%3Aarea%2Fdeflake+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
- Any kubernetes org member can make an org-level GitHub Project, if we feel like it'd be helpful to have a board with columns to drag issues/PR's around
- Deflaking seems like an effort that is: time-bounded, fixed-scope, cross-sig... all things that make it sound like a working group",open,False,2019-01-08 02:26:27,2019-01-08 15:04:31

We view the contributor guide as a place where all contributors - developers, writers, etc can get the same information and if anything speaks to solely the developers persona, it should go in a dev guide.

We need to edit the contributor guide PR doc:
- A lot of folks who only want to contribute to our contributing docs and end up getting stuck on the dev environment pieces that they don't need.
- Need to add disclosures / separate code/non-code concerns
- There are also significant ""setting up your dev environment"" steps in there that should just live elsewhere, not really in a ""how to pull request"" doc!

If a test is known to be using Linux-specific features
(e.g.: seLinuxOptions) or is unable to run on Windows nodes, it is labeled
`[LinuxOnly]`. When using Windows nodes, this tag should be added to the
`skip` argument.

This tag was proposed during [1][2].

- https://slackhq.com/introducing-user-groups
- https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group
- https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004952926-Manage-permissions-for-user-groups

Use cases that would help me:
- I am the release team lead, and I want to ping `@k8s-release-team` rather than have to copy paste a list of names.  I would rather not use a separate channel ""#release-team"" because that could confuse contributors over which channel they should go to talk about release related stuff.
- I am a contributor and would like to ping `@k8s-testinfra-oncall` when prow seems down instead of having to look at go.k8s.io/oncall and figure out what slack username corresponds to that github user and ping them directly

Currently the [Slack Admin Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/5060a2e50c8cbe052dff5cdd0bfb48334be39b07/communication/slack-guidelines.md) say nothing about whether this feature is supported or not.  The Kubernetes Slack admin team would like to have a broader discussion about whether this is something the Kubernetes Slack admin team wants to support.

Concerns that were raised in the [#slack-admin thread where I asked about this](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C4M06S5HS/p1548440343116000?thread_ts=1547831577.065000&cid=C4M06S5HS):
- This would increase admin burden (suddenly everyone wants a user group)
- This would increase notification noise (I'll just spam the release team constantly)

Chatted with Paris on Slack about this - we agreed that 1 July 2019 or the release of 1.15 (whichever is sooner) would be a good time to nuke all the tombstones. Rationale behind this:

v1.14 gets released on 25 March. The next release (1.15) is usually after three months so that would be late June or early July. July is also almost half a year from now so we can be sure that all references/dependencies are corrected by then.

We also wanted to be safe and choose a date farther away because there are a lot of links throughtout the ecosystem which point to the api-conventions doc (amongst others).

Questions encountered during designs/reviews (answer or clarify in existing docs):

Issues encountered during code reviews (add guidance to relevant docs, or make more explicit if it already exists):
- [ ] don't increment storage version of a resource in the same release that introduces the new version (breaks HA upgrade)
- [ ] don't update callers that support version skew to older api servers (kubectl, controllers) to use new API versions in the same release where they are introduced
- [ ] when copying an existing resource to a new API group, [update roles to permit the new API group as well](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74531)

Checklists for developing and reviewing different types of API changes:
- [ ] New API group
- [ ] New resource
- [ ] New version of an existing resource
- [ ] New field in an existing resource (some guidance exists in [API changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md) doc, ensure it is up to date)

- Moderator selection process modelled after the k8s membership process. 
- Required yearly checkups for moderator teams.
- A proposed set of open slots for moderators, I just educated-guessed what I think a good number of moderators per property should be, so we can definitely adjust there. 
- A looser set of moderator pro tempore positions to allow for larger coverage for people who can't commit to full time moderation.

I think some well-defined roles will help increase contribution and provide opportunities for recognition. Starting this as a place to discuss which roles make sense for the SIG.

These can be regularly rotating positions (e.g., each release cycle, or something similar) to encourage more folks to get involved! As suggested by @parispittman, it would be awesome if each role also had an ""understudy"" or partner to help spread knowledge. 

Here are a few roles I think would be great to have as a starting point for discussion. Obviously they'll need a bit more definition!

### New contributor / community ambassador
Responsible for helping to welcome new contributors to the SIG, representing the interests of new contributors and the rest of the Kubernetes community (maybe two distinct roles?)

### Triage captain
Responsible for organizing the triage of new bugs and issues related to SIG network, maintaining issue backlog.

### Test captain

### Project manager
Responsible for helping to define project road map for SIG network.

It also relied on manually created issues replicating info already present in other places.

Over the past several months, the manual steps required to keep a secondary issue list current proved problematic.

This PR makes the following changes:
* adds whitespace and reorders some sections (separate commit, no content changes)
* simplifies the overview/goals section
* collapses the prereqs/submitters/reviewers/results sections into a single `mechanics` section with a clearer workflow:
  * proposes using a [project board in the kubernetes org](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/13) to improve visibility and issue triage query capability
  * proposes using a dedicated `api-review` label to indicate an API review is needed on any issue or PR in the kubernetes org
  * describes a review workflow that allows using existing github issues/PRs, and existing github and PR dashboard queries to get visibility to assigned issues, review queue, and review status


Two well-understood bot changes are proposed to make this workflow possible and easier to engage with:
  * `/api-review` and `/api-review cancel` commands to let org members request or cancel API review requests
  * an auto-commenter that comments on PRs/issues labeled with `kind/api-change` referencing this document and noting the steps to request a review

Overall, there's been positive reception so far, but I'd like to document the intent and open the floor for comments. This is something that would get added as something in-scope for the forthcoming SIG PM charter.

Some thoughts:
- Socialize the idea (happening now)
- Create a `project-board-maintainers` team - initially @jdumars and myself - https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/496
- Assign the `project-board-maintainers` team write permissions to the following projects:
  - Steering: https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/projects/1
  - PM
    - SIG PM: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/14
    - KEP Implementation Tracking: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/5
  - Architecture:

    - API Reviews: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/13 (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3261#pullrequestreview-204503307)
- Expand `project-board-maintainers` team
- Onboard additional boards

Additionally, there is some chatter around [project mgmt improvements in ContribEx](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3079). We should work to consolidate that discussion under SIG PM.

fixes #359 

Took a first pass at adding the link checker. `hack/verify-links.sh` should get picked up in the make verify step. Everything else is just adding the dependancies for the link checker. It make sense to save the output somewhere so you can actually see what's failing. Right now I have an `$OUTPUT` variable just pointing to `/tmp/` that I would love to update before this is approved to run.  

I could find an example of anyone using any binaries from test-infra so I did my best to piece together a working solution. Please let me know if there is a better way to access the linkcheck binary i.e. is test-infra already accessible from where the tests are run making the extra vendor folders redundant. 

Other items of note, when I checked there were 5000 links. Of those 140 links 404 and anything going to reddit was giving me a 429 from my office network. The three 429s do a 100, 200, and then 400 second retry before failing adding 35 minutes to the run time. If they still 429 when it runs from CI I'll look into filtering them out.",open,True,2019-02-28 03:46:30,2019-03-20 13:02:34

We trust 201 participants to find their own things to work on, but people with less open source experience and less outgoing personalities will struggle with this. We can and should match 101 contributors with their first issue.

Because of the size of the workshop, this should be doneby grouping contributors by interest and skillset.

This will take some work.

- [ ] Create and send out with registration a questionnaire asking participants' experience level, about interest/skill in docs, golang, containers, ""Dont' know"" is an ok answer too

- [ ] Group people by interest (2-5 people per group?)

- [ ] Find a good first issue for each group in real k8s/* or k8s-sigs/* repos and reserve it

- [ ] Match and guide folks during the final part of the NCW. Collaborative PRs can still have a level of authorship, I believe? 

The group aspect makes this a little trickier; but I hope to avoid matching 100 people to 100 issues; that's not scalable.

This will also help us in prioritizing and providing direction to our work.

SIG Cluster Lifecycle has a doc on how they do this, we could start here: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle/grooming.md. I was totally blown away by how @timothysc conducted the latest Public Steering Committee meeting ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3ySJ09clgQ)) using this method and I think it would be neat to incorporate something like this for our SIG as well. :)

These are the action items I see right now, feel free add suggestions too!

- [x] We go through the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/1) in our weekly meetings. Instead, we should break this down into boards per subproject (see https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3283). We can keep the main board for things that are more cross-subproject.
- [x] Make sure almost all issues have a `kind/`, `area/` and `priority/` label. 
- [x]  Create a milestone with a reasonable due date (sometime in May before KubeCon Barcelona?)
- [x] Maybe create a team `community-milestone-maintainers` to make sure this team can use the `/milestone` command. There are many folks/subproject owners who are active in contribex, but don't necessarily have write access to the repo. They should be able to add milestones too.
- [x] Add milestones to issues that seem like a good candidate for May.

Reserve one of our weekly meetings to discuss and groom the project board:

- [x] Plan and discuss which issues should stay and which ones can be removed from the current milestone (mainly look for issues that are high priority-wise and can be reasonable done by the due date).

- [x] Assign people to work on each of the issues. If an issue isn't too critical and can be done by new-ish contributors, we should use `help wanted` and `good first issue` labels and offer mentorship for them.

Finally when this is done, in our regular weekly meetings, we can walk through the issues in this milestone instead of the whole project board. We could probably let subproject owners just give us a quick update on the issues, instead of going through each one too.

community,mrbobbytables,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3454,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/3454,Process doc for subproject site requests,"This is a follow-up to several discussions on slack and some preliminary investigation.

Several subprojects have grown large and complex enough to warrant their own site to house easily discoverable documentation. These subprojects fall out of scope for documentation on the main kubernetes.io site. Some notable examples include [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and [kubebuilder](http://kubebuilder.io) with [others approaching the idea](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CCTBSCVB9/p1552504190060100?thread_ts=1552499704.055600&cid=CCTBSCVB9).

These subproject sites should be managed under Kubernetes community owned resources instead of being tied to the personal accounts of subproject owners.

Most of the requirements and original process discovery were mapped by @BenTheElder in https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/issues/184 and put together in a subsequent [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQxPelCL7pT9H9IseaHoeqJyjx11EeRv2PU-EJPgAcg/edit#heading=h.yq3cchhwyeyu).

A [WIP process doc](https://hackmd.io/EjGIQReKQTG8bPTd5H-QmA?view) has been started with one large outstanding task:
 - Sort out how best to enable netlify integration for specific repos while ensuring they are managed under the correct netlify team.

Currently this requires temporarily adding a sig-docs member with netlify access to be granted write permission to the repo to configure the integration...which is something I don't think we really want to do...

After some investigation, the ideal method would be for a subproject owner to [request approval for the netlfiy app](https://help.github.com/en/articles/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps) where it could then be quickly processed by the github admin team. To do this, we will need to verify this workflow and ensure that any repos processed this way wind up being owned by the correct netlify team.

With that I think there are 4 real AI/questions that remain:

- [ ] Test and verify repo/netlify request workflow.
- [ ] Decide which repo should own the subproject site request issue template (k/website? k/community? k/org? k/k8s.io?)
- [ ] Decide where process doc should be located (k/community/communication?)
- [ ] Update process doc with final workflow.

community,nikopen,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3455,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/issues/3455,Nuke 'triage' labels / replace them with 'lifecycle' or other ,"Triage labels are a bit old and unused. Following discussions on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-contribex/BvGmOQ0v5f0 , the proposal is to instantiate a new workflow roughly defined at the discussion above and here kubernetes/test-infra#11818 (comment) - introduce a new label that allows SIGs to sort new issues and filter valid ones / label them / organize upcoming work in an approximately scheduled way.

As a first step, the proposal is to nuke and reclaim 'triage' labels so they are not confusing anyone.

Further idea for a replacement is to use the 'lifecycle' labels, which can be reworked and actively used more.

Roughly:

1. Auto-label 'lifecycle/active' (which means 'in progress') when someone is assigned into an issue.
2. 'lifecycle/stale' automatically kicks in in 90 days currently - might be useful to have something milder for 30 days, only when 'lifecycle/active' is already there
3. 'lifecycle/active' gets removed when issue is closed.
4. Perhaps rename 'lifecycle/active' to 'lifecycle/inprogress' to be more clear
5. Absorb any 'triage' labels that can be useful into 'lifecycle'.
    Current triage labels from the (outdated) https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md#closing-issues:
```
    triage/support: Indicates an issues is not a bug but a support request.
    triage/duplicate: Indicates an issue is a duplicate of other open issue.
    triage/not-reproducible: Indicates an issue can not be reproduced as described.
    triage/needs-information: Indicates an issue needs more information in order to work on it.
    triage/unresolved: Indicates an issue that can not be resolved.

Related initial discussion for point 1. can be found here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-contribex/BvGmOQ0v5f0 , the rest should be further discussed in some meeting - 1.14 release retro is a good candidate

Series of items and features that would be beneficial if implemented:

1. All issues hitting K/K are auto-labeled as 'needs-sig-triage' or something similar.

``` 

2. SIGs are tasked by definition to regularly search all issues and appropriately label them / categorize them. This is made much easier by implementing point 1.

3. Each SIG has a dedicated project/Kanban board each, where visibility of current and upcoming work and milestoned work is very, very visible with a quick glance - columns like Backlog, In Progress, Release-Blocking, etc. cc @parispittman @idvoretskyi on boards but for broader project usage

  Case in point: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/8 , the SIG-Windows board has worked great, both for them as a SIG and sig-release / release issue triage.

4. After SIG reviews the new ticket(issue), it gets an appropriate category - either via direct labels or via Project Board automated labels. thockin suggested the use of `triage` labels which are a bit legacy and should be reworked in tandem with project boards to have the desired workflow.
An example on a project board being: issues moved from 'backlog' to 'in progress' automatically get a 'triage/inprogress' label (or smth similar). Label Automation + Projectboards + searchQueries should all have seamless integration and compliment each other in the final iteration of the new workflow.

5. Release team specific: Based on all above, incoming 'milestoned' work is work that belongs to SIGs and it should be a SIG's responsibility to control and estimate what can be done for each release cycle, with the release team stepping in only when needed (as release approaches). Standard calendar checkpoints in release-readiness will further help - this is what the 'Enhancements Deadline' stands for, but doesn't cover stuff outside of new features and that work is usually left for the release team to ponder upon their fate.

6. Therefore, a prototype flowchart is: New Ticket -> SIG -> Labeling or Deletion <-> Project Boards <-> Re-labeling based on current status <-> Release Team is able to view status at any time via project boards

7. For all above, mass rework of labels is needed.
'priority' labels are a subject of discussion in every release cycle as it's a fuzzy concept in itself, should be reworked with ideas such as 'impact' and 'importance' in mind,
'triage' labels are a bit old and currently mostly unused but can be very helpful if properly reworked and integrated into a standard system,
'kind' labels can be further reworked as there are many issues that do not belong in any current 'kind' (cc @BenTheElder)
deletion of unwanted labels or re-work into other ones,
addition of new labels like 'needs-sig-triage', 'release-blocking', 'wontfix' etc.
related initial issue for 'triage' labels: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3455

8. and with that all, rework of the old document located in https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md and possibly updating many others

Other generic improvements include:

- Mechanism that auto-applies milestone in PRs that are merged out of code freeze, so the full list of PRs included in 1.14 is easily grepped
(issue is here https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/11611)

- Label that signifies an Issue/PR that is changing something Outside of core k/k, whether it's testing/releng/automation/dependencies/external bundles like fluentd-gcp et cetera. Currently there's only a `kind/cleanup` which is rather vague. Label variety should be encouraged - with proper standardization, good ruling and automation around them they can be easily understood and utilized.

  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WA8N7C48nkJmme9a96DU0o9jBpeycPhht8WF-Eam9QQ/edit?usp=sharing

- Labels that indicate whether a ticket is release-blocking or good-to-have, e.g. (kind/release-blocking | kind/good-to-have)

- Label + mechanism that automatically shifts a Ticket to the next milestone

  a few days after Freeze hits - this automates punting of 'good-to-have' stuff to the next milestone

- Any ticket in the release-blocking column of a board automatically gets a kind/release-blocking label - this way, anyone can search github issues and PRs via `label:kind/release-blocking+milestone:v1.14` query

Technically, committees also own repos (and thus ""code"") so I guess it makes sense to list these as subprojects?

Today this is supposed to be done via the community calendar.  Upon recent switch to Daylight savings time, we discovered a number of oddities with the community calendar and found out it's in a sad state. 

1. A number of meetings did not exist there, including the community meeting 
2. Meeting invites looked correct but did not update properly during the daylight savings switch 
3. Contribex should have co-ownership of the meetings 

This is table stakes for the community imo, and we should audit both the instructions and the meetings.

> in line with [GKE's supported upgrades policy](
https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/clusters/upgrade).

It seems like it might be okay to drop that last line in the docs, as I'm not sure why Kubernetes should tie its own versioning policies to a specific vendor's versioning policies. It would be better if we could reference a more general industry rule, or just mention that ""supporting more than three minor versions would place an undue burden on the Kubernetes maintainers"". But appealing to some docs for one particular vendor doesn't really seem to hold as much water for me (especially considering I don't currently run any clusters on GKE and don't have plans to at this time).",open,False,2019-03-19 16:08:00,2019-03-19 16:30:40

It appears as though there is no explicit part of the Kubernetes project that owns the blog.  I raised the issue during steering, and suggested we formalize this effort as a subproject that can be staffed by reviewers and approvers who work for more companies than LF/CNCF.

There are existing policies and people in charge of this stuff, and all of these currently live in a repo that is owned by sig-docs, so I think this should be a sig docs subproject.  This is not to put the onus on sig-docs chairs, but to instead recognize the folks that are already doing this as part of the community, and documenting any gaps to ensure others can help out if they're interested

Things that end up not belonging to anyone end up being owned by Contrib Ex. This is a first draft at nailing down exactly what we should be responsible for and what we should not be responsible for.

Note that this effectively removes ContribEx as the default moderator of all the kubernetes properties. The project will still need this work to get done, so where appropriate I've moved that back to the SIGs, and for everything else it will require discussion or perhaps a new community structure to manage those things. 

Changes: 

- Explicitly add Kubernetes Gsuite as a responsibility
- Explicitly add CNCF as the lead owner of Zoom, YouTube, and Slack
accounts
- Begin to document responsibilities around contributor summits between
this SIG and the CNCF
- Explicitly remove moderation of social properties as a responsility
- Explicitly remove closing down working groups as a responsibility
- Explicitly remove SIG Calendar, lists, YouTube playlists, and Zoom

1- calendaring: right now, some sigs are following the guidelines we've laid out as best practice but how can we make this better? this requires 40+ shared calendars with chairs needing to keep up on access perms and maintenance of their calendars. can we centralize this and still share ownership with sigs/chairs/people who need it? can we use the gsuite api to make this better? can sigs.yaml power the calendar? 
past issues: sig meetings not showing up on community calendar, calendar owner is no longer here - temp or perm - to edit/cancel/delete/reschedule, invite not set up correctly (transparency perms, no info, etc.)

2- documentation ownership: individuals own docs vs the project. can we centralize this and still share ownership with sigs/chairs/people who need it? can we use the gsuite api to make this better? can we use team drive in places that make sense like storing of contribex files that don't go in a github repo? Current issue with gsuite: we don't have access to create team drives. 
past issues: can't transfer ownership of document after someone goes MIA, permissions issues when creating, sharing issues

3- should we explore sigs having a gsuite account (more users) so that there is a centralized point for their documents, mailing lists, calendars, etc. and when they transfer chair responsibilities, there is a key that is passed for everything? how are other nonprofit like structures that need public documents built on gsuite - preferably examples from very large nonprofits with several departments that need our level of transparency? contributors@ was set up as a user so we will need to share the credentials with a lot of folks to play with automation, etc. which doesn't seem to make sense. curious as to what others are doing and if we can get guidance from google here. 

4- can we further automate youtube video processing from zoom cloud to youtube by use of team drive? 

5- can we automate github processes like rewards and rec systems to use gsuite to generate emails, calendar events, etc.?


what else did I miss?

A short template for intra-SIG governance has been developed in order to simplify SIG creation, and additional templates are being developed, but SIGs should be relatively free to customize or change how they operate, within some broad guidelines and constraints imposed by cross-SIG processes (e.g., the release process) and assets (e.g., the kubernetes repo).

As an example, `ReplicaSet` embeds the `PodTemplateSpec` type in its spec, but [alters the semantics of certain fields](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/602c3eb0e610520521c0eb750d9b36dd60c64393/pkg/apis/apps/validation/validation.go#L646), for example:

- You may not set the `activeDeadlineSeconds` field on a `PodTemplateSpec` within a `ReplicaSet`
- You must always use `RestartPolicyAlways` in a `PodTemplateSpec` within a `ReplicaSet`

It would be very useful to have some guidance within the API conventions on the best way to approach decision making around additional or altered semantics when designing APIs that embed types, especially types like `PodTemplateSpec` that are pervasively used.",open,False,2019-04-02 17:17:26,2019-04-05 02:46:04

We need a set of published guidelines describing how to write good conformance tests.  Anecdotally we know of lots of tests that are not portable, or do not adequately test conformance against a desired set of functionality, but most of that information is in people's heads.  So lets rather get it in a doc that we can refer people to, and improve over time.

Here is an equivalent doc that I wrote many years ago for e2e tests, to give a flavor of what we're after.

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/writing-good-e2e-tests.md

Volunteers?

One way of doing it would be to:

1. Interview an experienced conformance test reviewer, to get a braindump of what constitutes good and bad conformance tests. (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels/area%2Fconformance)
2. Go through all of the historical PR reviews of conformance tests, to check that all previous rejection reasons have been covered. (As above, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels/area%2Fconformance)
3. Write the doc.
