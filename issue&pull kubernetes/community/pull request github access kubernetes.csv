It covers the reasoning and background at a high level but I'm still pulling together the proposed design (one exists, just not in paper).

Basically, add a new ""initialization"" phase for resources that is opaque to old clients but controllers can opt in to seeing uninitialized objects - the last initializer makes the object visible to everyone else.  Also, add non-mutating generic webhooks for doing remotable checks against a server (like SubjectAccessReview). Make both of those dynamically configurable via some core API object.

The only comment I did not address is: ""Cumulative cpu usage needs to be accompanied with time window from which it was collected.""
It may make sense to add the start time to the endpoint.  This would give the full time window as the ""end time"" is the timestamp.
I plan to omit the start time for now, as it isnt really a ""metric"", since it is constant.
Other than computing the long-term average cpu usage, I also dont see a use for the start time.  Comparing two sequential sets of metrics would produce a short term usage rate over the time period between the two metrics.  @vishh had expressed a desire to include this short-term rate in addition to the long term total in the endpoint as well.
Regardless, I think this is something that should be addressed when we decide on the format of the endpoint.  The set of metrics as laid out in the proposal should cover this case.

We need it because we need to compare DaemonSet template with DaemonSet pods to know if the pods need to be updated, and:

1. Pod template hash isn't 100% reliable - it may change on PodTemplate API changes (e.g. adding new fields), and users will encounter unexpected DeamonSet rolling update after upgrading Kubernetes to a different version. 
2. It's not easy to infer pod template from a pod's spec, since many default values are applied to the pod, and the admission controller may update the pod as well.

--- 
Copied from my comment in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/41116#issuecomment-279817775:

1. In DaemonSet update strategy, PodTemplateGeneration++ on DS.spec.template updates
2. When DS creates pods, label them with current PodTemplateGeneration (""pod-template-generation=n"")
    - Use labels since it's easy for the controller and the users to filter pods that match current podtemplate generation.
3. DS compares pods' ""pod-template-generation"" label against its own PodTemplateGeneration to decide to kill (update) this pod or not.

One drawback is that it's not extensible (customized controllers that extend DaemonSet controller will have to modify API server code as well) - we decided not to worry about this for now. 

Another drawback is that in the rollback case (in the future), we may restart more pods than we want (since we can only roll forward PodTemplateGeneration), and pods gen 1 may actually be the same as DS gen 3. 

We can solve the rollback case with DaemonSet history + pod template hash. We use history objects (maybe stand-alone PodTemplate objects?) to store pod-template-hash and templates, and we compare pods' pod-template-hash labels with history and compare history template with DaemonSet template. 

**Alternatives:** 
1. I thought about using `json.Marshal` before hashing the object so that new fields with `omitempty` wouldn't change the hash value. However, if a new field was added to PodTemplate with some default value, the hash will still change. 
2. White-listing fields we care about when hashing pod template... this is not extensible. 
3. Implement a helper function that gives you podtemplate given a pod spec. This is hard to implement, as many default values will be added to a pod, and admission controller will also update the pod.","['lavalamp', 'erictune']",1,2017-02-15 00:21:23,2017-02-22 23:18:44,2017-02-23 21:19:00,True,2017-02-22 23:18:44,janetkuo,unknown,,closed

community,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/pulls/380,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/380,dashpole,[Proposal] Eviction Soft is Relative to Hard Eviction Threshold(s),"The purpose of soft evictions, as I understand them, is to allow for pods to burst for short periods of time without evicting them.

In the current state of things, we have the ""eviction-hard"" threshold, and the ""eviction-soft"" threshold.  However, once we implement #348, we essentially have two ""hard eviction"" thresholds.

Consider the following scenario (excluding this change, but including #348):
--eviction-hard=memory.available<10%
--eviction-soft=memory.available<15%
--kube-reserved=cpu=100m, memory=100Mi
--system-reserved=cpu=100m, memory=100Mi
Node Capacity = cpu: 1000m, memory=1000Mi

Doing the math, we get:
eviction-hard=cpu<900m, memory<900Mi
eviction-soft=cpu<850m, memory<850Mi
allocatable=cpu (of only pods) <700m, memory (of only pods) <700m

If system usage is cpu=100m, memory=100Mi, then we will hit the ""hard"" allocatable threshold before the ""soft"" eviction-soft threshold.
Since the purpose of soft evictions is to **not** immediately evict them, but allow them to burst, this is not ideal.

I see two possible solutions:
1.  Add a separate allocatable-soft flag for soft evictions before hitting allocatable thresholds
2. Convert eviction-soft to be relative to hard eviction thresholds, and in the future, use this value as a soft threshold for both eviction-hard, and allocatable limits.

This proposal covers option 2.

community,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/pulls/404,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/404,calebamiles,Adds proposal for ELB tagging,"## User story

Customer likes AWS ELBs but they need the ELBs to have [custom AWS resource tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) so that their internal billback system doesn't delete ELBs created by Kubernetes that don't have a customer specific team tag. The Kubernetes AWS tagging feature [currently offered isn't flexible enough](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/aws_under_the_hood.md#tagging).

## Proposal

Create a new AWS specific annotation for services which will list the additional tags that should be applied to an AWS ELB Resource. Any labels which overlap with those used internally by the AWS Cloud Provider would be ignored. An example annotation would have the form

```
aws.kubernetes.io/additional-resource-tags=""Owner=AwesomeTeam,Project=Testing""
```

and would create tags at the same time all other tags are created by the cloud provider. In the future it may make sense to add the ability to specify additional labels [in the cloud provider configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/aws/aws.go#L385) in order to allow all provisioning tools to apply labels to resources besides ELBs.

1. Use PodTemplate to store DaemonSet history 
1. Use ""pod-template-generation"" to label both pods and PodTemplates, so that DaemonSet controller can map a pod to a PodTemplate (history), and than compare PodTemplate with DaemonSet template 
1. Each PodTemplate is a snapshot of DaemonSet template + annotation + templateGeneration at the moment. A DaemonSet can have multiple PodTemplates with the same template (each with a unique pod-template-generation label)
1. Default clean up policy for DaemonSet history is 2. Only PodTemplates with no existing pods map to it can be cleaned up (so that a pod can always be mapped to a PodTemplate). 
1. Rollback will be done server side using RollbackConfig, similar to Deployment 

An alternative is to create a DaemonSetHistory resource, and/or use template hash instead of template generation.

I've been talking to @msau42 and @saad-ali and with upcoming scheduler changes it would be much better not to allow generic selector as proposed in #247, which is hard to evaluate and allow only exact configuration of dynamic provisioning using ConfigMaps in user namespace(s).

I leave both PRs open and close one when we decide which way to go.

Pros of ConfigMaps:

  *  PVCs are platform independent, as long as user supplies updated `ConfigMap(s)` when deploying to another platform.

  * It is strict and thus easier to handle in the provisioner and in scheduler. No selectors like ""zone NOT IN [east, west]""

Cons:

 * It works only with dynamic provisioning.
   * With Selectors, user might request a PV with certain labels and a PV would be provisioned *only* if no existing PV matched.
   * With `ConfigMap`, a PV must be always dynamically provisioned as we don't have any way how to check if an existing PV conforms to a `ConfigMap`.

 * One extra object to care about.

 * External dynamic provisioners must be able to read all ConfigMaps on the system. This should be OK as long as users don't use ConfigMaps for their mysql passwords.


Again, ""zone"" is used here just for an example, it may be phased out by upcoming scheduler changes, but we still need a way how to configure encryption or nr. of Gluster replicas.

Right now each group has to manually update or create their own content, which often leads to missing sections, duplication and an unnecessary maintenance burden. 

This PR introduces a single metadata YAML file which structures SIG data in a consistent way. The small Go app in the `build` folder generates READMEs based off this metadata, and also updates the `sig_list.md` in the project root. I tried to use existing software to do this (mustache CLI, jq and pandoc), but trying to integrate them soon became unworkable when compared to a small Go binary that could do the same thing.

A different approach is needed, I've chosen 'Add an option in VolumeMount API', but I would be fine also with 'Add an option in HostPathVolumeSource', there is only very small difference to me.

The proposal also describes how it will be implemented, especially during alpha phase.

This adds the notion of a default seccomp profile for kubernetes to the alpha seccomp support.

It details the various interactions with capabilities added to containers and covers some of the important syscalls that will be blocked by default.

A restricted node with a single workload is a dedicated node.

Specifically, PodSecurityPolicies will allow certain Tolerations. This will permit placement on restricted nodes.

Unfortunately, this is insufficient, as one purpose for dedicated nodes is to permit privileged workloads. Granting a PodSecurityPolicy with privileged execution compromises the whole cluster, because the privileged workload could land anywhere.

The Taint/Toleration relationship must be reversed, so that nodes can tolerate pod taints. The recommended implementation is a new type of symmetric Taint/Toleration. The PodSecurityPolicy would then need a list of *required* Tolerations.",['davidopp'],2,2017-06-14 07:20:56,2017-06-21 06:50:52,2017-06-21 07:01:38,False,,,unknown,,closed

Specifically I believe that the first task of the newly elected steering committee will be to draft new governance global to the project and submit this new governance to a vote of the ""community of standing"". This would finish the bootstrap process.

This is what I call bylaws in https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/351

They are (or is) the simplest document possible that describe the governance:

- the membership and how one moves in this membership (e.g vote, no vote, emeritus, nomination, etc...)
- the various groups (e.g steering committee, SIGs, incubator)
- how decisions are made (e.g vote, no vote, lazy consensus etc).
- how each ""project"" is governed (e.g how decisions are made in helm)
- where the community lives which implies where are decisions made.

We came to agreement on using the strategy:
### Only evict pods where usage > requests.  Then sort by Function(priority, usage - requests)
This solution provides users with a clear path to avoiding evictions. It prevents abuse by high-priority pods by not allowing them to disrupt other pods that are below, or near their requests.  Using a function provides a more nuanced approach to allowing pods to consume ""unused"" (not requested) memory on the node.  Power users, or cluster administrators can determine how unused memory is allocated to pods by choosing priority levels for pods that are closer for more equal sharing of extra memory, or further apart to give better availability to higher priority pods.  For pods that have equal priority, the function is equivalent to usage - requests, so that clusters that do not have priority enabled maintain behavior that is similar (though not exactly the same) as today's behavior.

This PR changes the eviction documentation to include this change in the eviction strategy, and removes outdated information on inode eviction.

Therefore we should introduce some generic versioning mechanism so old provisioner that don't support new features know that a newer feature is requested and not provision a PVC.

There are two new annotations introduced, one that makes the PVCs that need newer features invisible to the old provisioner, second one introduces very simple versioning based on Kubernetes release.

We missed this in 1.8 development and now it becomes a bug. Should we fix it before 1.8 is released?

This PR proposes solutions to bring pod preemption closer to Beta/GA. It particularly proposes solutions to solve the existing starvation problem and to support PodDisruptionBudget. It also explains why we have decided to not support certain features, namely, inter-pod affinity on lower priority pods, and cross node preemption.
The PR also covers changes proposed to Cluster Autoscaler to work better with preemption.

For CPU and Memory allocatable, enforcing allocatable through cgroups provides protection from being starved of compute resources by user pods.
However, for ephemeral-storage it seems that the node-level enforcement mechanisms are able to prevent the node from running out of disk, and thus prevent impact to system daemons.
Additionally, memory usage metrics read from cgroups or statfs are far more reliable than an aggregation of `du` calls which may be collected at different times (as https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/52336 demonstrated).
(As a side note, we should read from the /kubepods cgroup to determine allocatable memory usage)
We should still keep the scheduling aspects of node allocatable for ephemeral storage, as this allows for proper accounting.  But I would like to remove enforcement of node allocatable for ephemeral storage.

This is the starting point for creating a single source of truth for how to contribute to Kubernetes.

A follow-up umbrella issue will be filed that contains a list of tasks that need to be completed to fully  migrate all the information to a central source of truth.

The README itself contains references to tasks that are still outstanding, but it would be helpful to have it merged into master, so we have somewhere to point people, to make them aware this is being worked on, and perhaps to garner more help.

It's a pain point for multi-zone clusters deployment since cross-zone network traffic being charged, while in-zone is not. In addition, cross-node traffic may carry sensitive metadata from other nodes. Therefore, users always prefer the service backends that close to them, e.g. same zone, rack and host etc. for security, performance and cost concerns.

Kubernetes scheduler can constraining a pod to only be able to run on particular nodes/zones. However, Kubernetes service proxy just randomly picks an available backend for service routing and this one can be very far from the user, so we need a topology-aware service routing solution in Kubernetes. Basically, to find the nearest service backend.

Actually, we are working on a POC about this proposal and there was strong support for us to open source this work, which we are happy to do.

With CSI in development, there are now two different ways to implement out-of-tree volume plugins in Kubernetes. This doc aims to demystify the differences and provide answers to common questions from storage vendors that come up while deciding between CSI and FlexVolume.

Once this is merged, I'll add a link to this doc here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#out-of-tree-volume-plugins

There are several applications like SIP apps or RTP which needs a lot of ports to run multiple calls or media streams. Currently there is no way to allow a range in ports in spec. So essentially users may have to do this:

```
- name: sip-udp5060
  containerPort: 5060
  protocol: UDP
- name: sip-udp5061
  containerPort: 5061
  protocol: UDP
  ...
- name: sip-udp5559
  containerPort: 5559
  protocol: UDP
```

Doing above for 500 ports is not pretty. Can we have a way to allow port ranges like 5060-5559?

## Objective

This proposal builds off of earlier requests to [Support port ranges in services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/23864) and aims to document all the requirements of supporting port ranges in services.

There have been misunderstandings on the means because of the way
accepted has been used elsewhere on the project.

For example, some reviewing the Application object/CRD PR though expected meant implementable or that this was the accepted design direction that would be expected to implement. Since this is a new process I would argue the naming should follow the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) and attempt to be intuitive even to those not familiar with the process (which is most people at the moment).

This proposed change moves the term to draft which is used buy other projects
such as the IETF standards track.

Why are we doing this:

- The scope of the Kubernetes project is such that having a role for holistic maintenance of the entire project in all capacities is not practical.  Scoping responsibilities to specific *subprojects* within the Kubernetes project is feasible.
- Through automation improvements direct write access to the kubernetes/kubernetes will no longer be necessary for maintenance of the project going forward.

- **Remove *maintainer* role and merge responsibilities into *owner* role**

I am a sig network member and currently is responsible for kube-proxy IPVS work. I am a full-time open source software engineer and have a team from huawei.

I have contributed 150+ commits to Kubernetes core repo and mainly focus on network area.

I would like to contribute more resources other than just writing codes. For example, I am keeping attending SIG-Network meeting so I can identify all features in the current release from the SIG-Network and track all features.

Currently the kubenet code supports applying basic traffic shaping during pod setup. This will happen if bandwidth-related annotations have been added to the pod's metadata, for example:

    {
        ""kind"": ""Pod"",
        ""metadata"": {
            ""name"": ""iperf-slow"",
            ""annotations"": {
                ""kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth"": ""10M"",
                ""kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth"": ""10M""
            }
        }
    }

Our current implementation uses the linux tc to add an download(ingress) and upload(egress) rate limiter using 1 root qdisc, 2 class(one for ingress and one for egress) and 2 filter(one for ingress and one for egress attached to the ingress and egress classes respectively).

Kubelet CNI code doesn't support it yet. However, there is enough functionality for us to add a simple CNI plugin to replicate the behavior we have today in kubenet if we feel this is an important feature. In fact, CNI has already supported traffic shaping plugin.

An alternative approach (elaborated on in the KEP) would be to augment the existing `kubeadm-config` directly without the use of additional ConfigMaps. The multiple ConfigMap approach makes more sense to me so that's what I decided to propose. If there is a lot of opposition to this approach, then I'm happy to draft a new KEP.

I will also work on prototyping this as we agreed. I just wanted to get something out there to get a more serious discussion moving.

community,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/pulls/1950,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1950,tallclair,[RFC] PodRestriction proposal,"This is a proposal for a new policy object (and associated admission controller) that adds basic restrictions to most fields on a Pod. This is motivated by a desire to unify the various policies we have now (which all behave in slightly different ways), and to unblock expanding the set of restricted fields. Furthermore, it aims to solve some of the key usability problems with PodSecurityPolicies, such as the inability to compose policies and the difficulty in binding policies.

**Help Wanted:** I don't actually have time to own the implementation of this proposal, so I'm looking for community members who are interested in realizing this. If we decide to move forward with this approach, my hope is that we can consolidate some of the efforts around other new restriction policies.

**Question**: Should this be rolled up into the overall [policy proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ht8wpj4j9YfAA7aVv9Yn3Ci1T_MLMWt0DBr0QmxI2OM/edit#heading=h.6l8mozsiyzb1) or something like [OPA](http://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html)? Alternatively, should this use a path-based OPA-style API?

This PR updates the seccomp design doc to indicate that we are enabling a default seccomp profile: docker/default. It pulls a few pieces from #660, but does not include the seccomp spec. The reasoning here is that we can simply enable docker/default as the first step and see how it works.

Therefore, when you calculate the pod level cgroup's cpu.shares should be the sum of resource.request.cpu of container ""foo"" and ""bar"",  which is 120m. The cpu share of burstable cgroup should also be modified to 130m.

Security Profile helps managing a secured Kubernetes cluster by solving problems of:

- Management complexity
  - Complicated configuration of control plane components' security-relevant command line flags, correctness of cert/key/config file permissions;
  - Requires deep understanding of Kubernetes policy objects like RBAC, PodSecurityPolicy, NetworkPolicy, ResourceQuota etc;
  - No support for automatic provisioning of namespaced policy objects upon namespace creation;
  - Requires of domain knowledge about security;
  - Requires keeping up with fast evolving Kubernetes security/isolation features, and update configurations accordingly;

- Extra efforts building in-house solutions
  - No standard/common ways to solve the problems;
  - It’s very difficult to make in-house solutions sharable/reusable, as a result, efforts are duplicated solving same/similar problems.

by defining curated settings of:

- Cluster bootstrapping configuration, like command line flags, file permissions, etc
- Cluster-scoped policy objects, like PodSecurityPolicy
- Namespace-scoped policy objects, like NetworkPolicy

And simplify the cluster management by specifying the name of security profile.


_This proposal is looking for sponsorship from sig-auth,
to create a public repo as [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles](),
that community can help curate commonly used security profiles.
Details are described in Release section in the proposal._

I made the following changes
- Updated with the new 1.10 API
- Added a naming section
  - This is a big one, I want to make sure we all use the same names to designate the same components
  - Feel free to comment on this
- Some small rewording

The names introduced here are:
- **Device Plugin**: The pod running on each node which allows kubelet and kubernetes to be ""device aware""
- **Device Plugin API**: The gRPC API which allows kubelet and the device plugins to communicate. 
- **Device Plugin API Container**: The container which communicates with kubelet through the Device Plugin API
- **device manager**: The part of Kubelet in charge of managing the device plugins

For example, if you rename `a.md` to `b.md` in a feature branch, updating an `../a.md` to `../b.md` target will work immediately (e.g. during pull-request review), while updating `https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/a.md` to `https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/b.md` will only work after your branch lands the rename in master.

I'm not sure why the `#L1454` fragment was part of the old sig-governance template sigs.yaml link, but it's been there since the template landed in 68658bff (#1830).  I've removed it in this commit.

The Kubernetes Charter README link in the sig-governance template could just be:

    [Kubernetes Charter README]: README.md

but I've sent it down to the project root and back to make life easier on new SIGs which copy/paste the file to a new location in this repository.  With this pull request they'll just need to drop one level of `../` to get the references working from places like `sig-contributor-experience/charter.md`.

I've also chased a few files and anchors as they've moved around, e.g. the `OBSOLETE_templates.md` rename from 18958f82 (#1010) and the ""and maintenance"" header addition from f471f6b6 (#1215).

Namespace Population is an automated mechanism to make sure the predefined policy objects
(e.g. NetworkPolicy, Role, RoleBinding) are present in selected namespaces.

## Motivation

Kubernetes users create namespaces (self-service namespace creation) and want to
ensure security/isolation policies are enforced between them and other users.
Just like addon manager creates cluster-scope policy objects like PodSecurityPolicy,
ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding at cluster creation time.
It creates namespace-scope policy objects during namespace creation time.

community,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/community/pulls/2183,https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2183,wking,SIG charter template: Separate SIG and subproject roles,"By separating the SIG and subproject roles, we can more tightly scope the previous ""Membership for roles tracked in: `sigs.yaml`"".  The SIG
roles are tracked there directly, but subproject roles are incorperated by reference.  Now that the subproject roles are in their own subsection, we can spend a bit more time talking about that indirection.

I've removed ""Seed members established at SIG founding"" from the chairs entry, because its already discussed in `/committee-steering/governance/README.md` (step 4).  There's no need to record that procedure in the charter itself, because the initial membership can be recovered from the version controlled history of `sigs.yaml`.

I've split the previous ""Members"" role into a SIG entry and a subproject entry to clarify that distinction.  The previous member line-items are mostly handled in other places now:

* ""maintain health of at least one subproject or the health of the SIG"", ""show sustained contributions to at least one subproject or to the SIG"", ""hold some documented role"", and ""Includes all reviewers and approvers"" are now addressed by the member definitions.
* ""build new functionality"" is not particularly clear, and for most subprojects anyone can contribute issues, pull requests, etc. without being a formal subproject member.
* ""participate in decision making for the subprojects they hold roles in"" is redundant with the other role definitions.

I've split the previous ""Subproject Owners"" into subproject approvers and reviewers.  This lets us define subproject members to include both
approvers and reviewers while restricting control over some activity (adjusting the `OWNERS` file) to approvers.  The ""alter their own `OWNERS`"" wording makes that line generic enough to allow for managing both approvers and reviewers, as well as anything else that the `OWNERS` file covers.

There is no implicit `OWNERS` nesting, all `OWNERS` entries must be listed in `sigs.yaml`.  This is a bit more work for `sigs.yaml` maintainers, but allows for owner/approver calculation without walking all referenced repositories.  We also have existing cases where parent and child `OWNERS` files are in different SIGs/subprojects.  For example, kubernetes/kubernetes has `/test/e2e/apps/OWNERS` in the workloads-api
subproject of SIG Apps, while the parent `/test/OWNERS` is in the testing-commons subproject of SIG Testing.

Because of the repo-root restriction, security contacts have an added wrinkle for nested subprojects.  The way I've worded it, kubernetes/kubernetes security contact would be a member of all subprojects with an `OWNERS` file in that repository (assuming the associated SIG had adopted wording like what I'm proposing with this pull request).  Members don't have many teeth (they mostly SHOULD approve things), and security contacts will have lots of trust, so the broad association here shouldn't cause any problems.

I've added a SHOULD for estabilishing security contacts for new repositories.  This will probably happen even without the reminder, but it's nice to be explicit.

I've also made assorted minor copy-edits near lines I touched.

CC @cblecker, since I'm spinning this off from our discussion [here][1].

This is the design proposal for the mechanism to migrate In-Tree Storage Plugins to use CSI Drivers instead. PTAL

Biggest caveats to look out for:
* Dynamic provisioning creates CSI PV's, not in-tree plugin PV's
* Nodes must be drained before turning feature on/off in Kubelet
* Deprecation of in-tree plugins will be a long pull, and at some point might break people if user does not take specific action on their self-managed clusters.
* Migration turned on/off with feature gates, may be un-configurable by users in managed environments","['saad-ali', 'msau42']",1,2018-05-29 22:53:41,2018-09-26 21:21:39,2018-09-26 21:21:39,True,2018-09-26 21:21:39,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

Currently, we don't have `sig/pm` in the list of labels in the label configuration in test-infra. Also, the bot command `/sig pm` doesn't work.

See https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/8336 which adds the label to the label configuration and allows the bot command to work. I think we should put an explicit hold on this PR until https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/8336 is merged.

Expand Kubernetes garbage collection to handle common uses which are awkward today. We will add an object-lifecycle-respecting TTL mechanism to the garbage collector. We will also allow users to mark resource objects to be cleaned up by the garbage collector after those objects are no longer in use: either terminated, completed, or not referenced by other resource objects. 

This KEP covers existing problems and an overview of a proposed solution. Implementation details are discussed separately (also linked in KEP):
1. Object-lifecycle-respecting TTL mechanism: https://goo.gl/9AUQ3n
2. Garbage collect resources that finish execution: https://goo.gl/ws9t3b
3. Garbage collect resources that are not used by other resources: https://goo.gl/KeHPiQ

This idea was prototyped in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-u2y03ufX7FzBDWv9dVI_HyiIQZL8iz3o3vabeOpP5Y/edit#) and has been reviewed over the course of the last week. Myself and @sttts think that now we have enough agreement and encouragement to move on with the proposal process and turn this into a KEP for more ""formal"" discussions.

Unfortunately, I have to do my military service starting from next week, which means I'll be unavailable for a fast response to review comments. I might have internet connection every now and then, but I don't know when I'll be able to answer this. Luckily @sttts will chime in here and help out by pushing agreed changes to this branch to make it mergeable. (This was semi-automatically converted from gdocs, there are probably a couple of formatting errors here still)

This is fine, but the `hack/run-in-gopath.sh hack/godep-restore.sh` command shows no progress information and often takes a lot of time.

So it's good to mention that if you want to see what is happening, you can use the `-v` flag to turn on the verbose mode of `godep restore`.

This pull request is about adding a sentence at the end of section [Restoring deps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/godep.md) explaining the possible use of the `-v` flag.

Some minor changes to the initial KEP after further discussions in the sig-api-machinery Slack channel.
Builds on top of https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/2354 and marks it as `implementable`.
We have now submitted and merged the ~5 first PRs of this effort, with more PRs planned and in the reviewing stage. We hope to get all of this implemented by v1.12 code freeze.

The additions to this version is that we've decided on a defaulting story, and know a bit more about the actual implementation plan, and know what tests to write up for the MVP.

I have added each of these as their own subprojects. Another approach
could be to make a ""code-organization"" subproject, and place both of

A lot of the diagrams I'm making now are for [Helm Charts](https://github.com/helm/charts), which I co-maintain.

I'm not sure if these importable libraries are appropriate for the community repo, but I'm opening this PR for discussion about that. Perhaps they are?

This PR currently includes SVG libraries matching the iconset directories in this repo, as well as one for the [SVG Kubernetes logos](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/logo). 

The libraries are currently only for draw.io. I'm not able to do this with Lucidchart because of a [SVG import and Text object](https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360014618646-SVG-import-and-Text-object) bug. We could export only the unlabeled icons for Lucidchart, or use PNGs for the labeled ones, but I didn't do that yet. Up for discussion.

to a newer version, but there is no a dedicated workflow for changing cluster attributes (except with using some workarounds, all of them with risks and pitfalls...)

This KEP aims to address this gap by proposing to implement a new kubeadm top level command (name TBD) for changing cluster attributes in a more controlled way.

The document is not complete, but hopefully it will provide enough context for letting the sig decide if this should be part of the next cycle or not...

It's a pain point for multi-zone clusters deployment since cross-zone network traffic being charged, while in-zone is not. In addition, cross-node traffic may carry sensitive metadata from other nodes. Therefore, users always prefer the service backends that close to them, e.g. same zone, rack and host etc. for security, performance and cost concerns.

Kubernetes scheduler can constraining a pod to only be able to run on particular nodes/zones. However, Kubernetes service proxy just randomly picks an available backend for service routing and this one can be very far from the user, so we need a topology-aware service routing solution in Kubernetes. Basically, to find the nearest service backend.

I have implemented a CronHPA which enables us to scale workloads(those support scale subresource) periodically using crontab scheme.

## Use cases
A lot of game player will play games from Friday evening to Sunday evening. It will be better to provide a better experience for players if game servers(pods) could be scaled to a lager size at Friday evening and scaled to normal size at Sunday evening. And that's what game server admins do every week.

Some other customers also do similar things because their products' usage also have peaks and valleys periodically. CronHPA is for their requirement.

## CronHPA example:
```
---
apiVersion: gs.io/v1alpha1
kind: CronHPA
metadata:
  name: example-cron-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    name: demo-deployment
  crons:
    - schedule: ""0 23 * * 5""  // Set replicas to 60 every Friday 23:00
      targetReplicas: 60
    - schedule: ""0 23 * * 7""  // Set replicas to 30 every Sunday 23:00
      targetReplicas: 30

---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:

This PR adds support for mentioning the stakeholder SIGs in `sigs.yaml`. `make generate` will then automatically update `sig-list.md` and the relevant WGs' `README.md`s. 

/hold
Do we want to add some stakeholder SIGs in this PR and iterate later? Or do we want to mention all of them in this PR?
Note: if we don't mention _any_ stakeholder SIGs right now, but want to add support for stakeholder SIGs in the generator, then I can modify the template for `sig-list.md` such that the ""Stakeholder SIGs"" column in not shown if none of the WGs have that specified.

- rename sig-release's ""release"" to ""release-team"" and
  add the release-team/OWNERS to owners

I did the SIG Release stuff while I was there, I can punt that if it's
too scope creepy. Main thing was I looked back and publishing-bot was
added in by someone from API Machinery. Neither of the people listed as
approvers for that codebase have ever attended SIG Testing. It seems
more like up SIG Release's alley than having anything to do with
Testing.

I chose the SIG Testing subprojects based on those= which seemed like they
could conceivably be extracted into their own repos if we someday wanted to.

There are others which I might want to group together and I didn't feel
like getting mired in that right now (ie: project config sorta spans
config, jobs, testgrid; github automation spans robots, maintenance,
some prow/cmd subdirs, etc.)

Fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/3199

Chatted with Paris on Slack about this - we agreed that 1 July 2019 or the release of 1.15 (whichever is sooner) would be a good time to nuke all the tombstones. Rationale behind this:

v1.14 gets released on 25 March. The next release (1.15) is usually after three months so that would be late June or early July. July is also almost half a year from now so we can be sure that all references/dependencies are corrected by then.

We also wanted to be safe and choose a date farther away because there are a lot of links throughtout the ecosystem which point to the api-conventions doc (amongst others).

I wanted to push this early so I can get plenty of review, so there are things missing like an issue template, etc. The general gist:

- Moderator selection process modelled after the k8s membership process. 
- Required yearly checkups for moderator teams.
- A proposed set of open slots for moderators, I just educated-guessed what I think a good number of moderators per property should be, so we can definitely adjust there. 
- A looser set of moderator pro tempore positions to allow for larger coverage for people who can't commit to full time moderation.

It also relied on manually created issues replicating info already present in other places.

Over the past several months, the manual steps required to keep a secondary issue list current proved problematic.

This PR makes the following changes:
* adds whitespace and reorders some sections (separate commit, no content changes)
* simplifies the overview/goals section
* collapses the prereqs/submitters/reviewers/results sections into a single `mechanics` section with a clearer workflow:
  * proposes using a [project board in the kubernetes org](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/13) to improve visibility and issue triage query capability
  * proposes using a dedicated `api-review` label to indicate an API review is needed on any issue or PR in the kubernetes org
  * describes a review workflow that allows using existing github issues/PRs, and existing github and PR dashboard queries to get visibility to assigned issues, review queue, and review status


Two well-understood bot changes are proposed to make this workflow possible and easier to engage with:
  * `/api-review` and `/api-review cancel` commands to let org members request or cancel API review requests
  * an auto-commenter that comments on PRs/issues labeled with `kind/api-change` referencing this document and noting the steps to request a review

follow-ups:
- [ ] revise the moderator section, since it hasn't been staffed yet (possibly coordinate with sig-pm to help there)
- [ ] update the pool expansion section to route requests through k/org instead of the mailing lists (and update templates for approver/reviewer requests/requirements there)","['mattfarina', 'justaugustus', 'jdumars', 'bgrant0607']",3,2019-02-15 08:10:41,2019-02-18 02:01:46,2019-03-14 18:59:04,True,2019-02-18 02:01:46,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

fixes #359 

Took a first pass at adding the link checker. `hack/verify-links.sh` should get picked up in the make verify step. Everything else is just adding the dependancies for the link checker. It make sense to save the output somewhere so you can actually see what's failing. Right now I have an `$OUTPUT` variable just pointing to `/tmp/` that I would love to update before this is approved to run.  

I could find an example of anyone using any binaries from test-infra so I did my best to piece together a working solution. Please let me know if there is a better way to access the linkcheck binary i.e. is test-infra already accessible from where the tests are run making the extra vendor folders redundant. 

Other items of note, when I checked there were 5000 links. Of those 140 links 404 and anything going to reddit was giving me a 429 from my office network. The three 429s do a 100, 200, and then 400 second retry before failing adding 35 minutes to the run time. If they still 429 when it runs from CI I'll look into filtering them out.",[],1,2019-02-28 03:46:30,,2019-03-20 13:02:34,False,,,unknown,,open

There's separate requirements about docs for the `stable` status below, and this is confusing various people
(e.g. https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript/pull/182)

Thus, I think it makes sense to delete this requirement.

`sigs.yaml` includes all our community groups except committees. This PR adds support for committees in the generator.

Note: since committees can have private mailing lists, I have added a new field `private_mailing_list` in the Contacts section. PTAL.

This PR also adds the Steering Committee, the Code of Conduct Committee and the Product Security Committee in `sigs.yaml`. I'll cc them on the PR for approval for their respective sections once the generator changes get lgtm (but will send an email to the steering ML now to get a general ok for the change).

Things that end up not belonging to anyone end up being owned by Contrib Ex. This is a first draft at nailing down exactly what we should be responsible for and what we should not be responsible for.

Note that this effectively removes ContribEx as the default moderator of all the kubernetes properties. The project will still need this work to get done, so where appropriate I've moved that back to the SIGs, and for everything else it will require discussion or perhaps a new community structure to manage those things. 

Changes: 

- Explicitly add Kubernetes Gsuite as a responsibility
- Explicitly add CNCF as the lead owner of Zoom, YouTube, and Slack
accounts
- Begin to document responsibilities around contributor summits between
this SIG and the CNCF
- Explicitly remove moderation of social properties as a responsility
- Explicitly remove closing down working groups as a responsibility
- Explicitly remove SIG Calendar, lists, YouTube playlists, and Zoom
settings as a responsibility
