ingress-nginx,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls/146,https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/146,chrismoos,Add health checking from NGINX to individual endpoints.,"## Overview

This change adds support for the [nginx_upstream_check_module](https://github.com/yaoweibin/nginx_upstream_check_module) and configures upstreams with health checks based on the readinessProbe in the service's pod(s).

It is configurable with ConfigMap (default disabled):

`use-upstream-health-checks`

If the upstream health checking is enabled there is also an additional endpoint at /upstream_status.

## Notes

This was originally proposed in the old NGINX ingress controller @ https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/2072

This change depends on a new `nginx-slim` image that would target version **0.13**. The PR for that is https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/2329

* Ingress references a backend on port `:8080`

The problem here is that the backend redirect to `:8080` but the ingress controller doesn't change the `Location:` header to `:80`, which is the port the ingress controller is listening.

What I have observed so far is that, when using `proxy_pass` with an upstream, the `$proxy_port` variable on nginx is `80` regardless of the port being used on upstream and backends.

Initial support for thi scenario was added as a result of this issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/1492

I had to do a couple things to get it to work:

1. Build `nginx-ingress-controller` myself since it has not been published in quite a long time.

2. Downgrade to a version of `nginx-slim` that is actually published (kind of weird)...

3. Add a new annotation for `auth-signin` that tells nginx where to send 401s to.

4. Add a couple extra `X-*` headers for things being reverse-proxied that expect them.

As a bonus:

1. Parameterize `DOCKER` in the Makefile similar to `PREFIX` and `RELEASE` for those of us building and pushing to non-GCR repositories.

2. Pulled out the URL parsing logic from the authrequest plugin to the parser since it seems to already hold util-type helpers.

* Creates a new function in 'ssl.go' for dealing with secrets that contain 'ca.crt' but doesn't contain tls.key or tls.crt
* Creating a conditional call in backend_ssl.go that calls each function described above, depending the in the condition the Secret was created
* Changes the nginx.tmpl to call the correct field (CAFileName), and also adds a default 'huge' ssl_verify_depth to deal with the intermediary CA chains (while this is not solved), and also pass to the backends a Header containing the 'authenticated' certs, so the app itself can authorize or not this.

TODO (on future PR):

* Make the ssl_verify_client configurable
* Create a directive that allows specifying also a CRL file
* Check if this is possible, and create a configurable 'redirect' directive when authentication is not succesful, as the following (an example is the following):
```
 if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
            redirect http://nossl.ingress.com/certerror.html;

When args ingress-class is empty, the default class is nginx so all the ingress without the annotation ""kubernetes.io/ingress.class"" must be builded. The current controller build all the ingress including ingress with anotation.

## Ex. empty arg 

Controller
```
containers:
      - args:
        - /nginx-ingress-controller    
....
```
## Empty class annotation (controller must build this)
```
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:    
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: ""true""
....
```


## Fixed class annotation (controller must NOT build this)
```
kind: Ingress

metadata:
  annotations:    
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: ""true""
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ""my-fake-class""
....
```

On the other side when args ingress-class is configured, just the ingress with the same class must be builded.

## Ex. with ingress args

Controller
```
containers:
      - args:
        - /nginx-ingress-controller    
        - --ingress-class=internal-nginx
....
```
## Empty class annotation (controller must NOT build this)
```
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:    
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: ""true""
....
```

## Fixed class annotation (controller must build this)
```
kind: Ingress

metadata:
  annotations:    
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: ""true""
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ""internal-nginx
....
```

HTML ""base"" tag is written for browser.

### Correct way
""base"" tag should be: `hostname/location/basename/`.
Then, a browser sends the request, something like this`<base>/filename`, to Nginx.
Then, this URI is translated into `service/target/basename/filename` by Nginx.

### Problem
However, in current code, it misses the `basename` part, and confuses the 'location' and 'target'.

### Solution
When the request comes to Nginx, the ""basename"" should be parsed at the entrance, in `buildLocation` method.

### Bug
There are 2 bugs in current ""AddBaseURL"":
1. When the rule's `host` field is an empty string, the ""base"" will be generated as `_`, which is wrong. The base-uri hostname should be the one in the HTTP request, `$http_host`.
2. Described in #67. Miss the basename part in base-uri, so that Nginx cannot find the resources. Even the unit-test cases, the `subs_filter` parts, are wrongly designed.

### Example
For the most complex case:

If we define a redirect rule like this,

| From  | To  |
|:-:|:-:|
| hostname/FROM  | service/TO  |

Then, we fetch a web page, `hostname/FROM/dist/index.html`
Inside this page's header, the `<base>` tag is generated:

| ❌ wrong ""base"" tag | ✅ correct ""base"" tag |
|:-:|:-:|
| hostname/TO/  | hostname/FROM/dist/  |

And, when this web page requests for a JS resource with a link `js/main.js`,

| ❌ wrong page sends | ✅ correct page sends |
|:-:|:-:|
| hostname/TO/js/main.js  | hostname/FROM/dist/js/main.js |

Of course, the wrong based request will get a 404.",['aledbf'],1,2017-03-13 17:58:36,2017-03-15 22:37:45,2017-03-15 22:37:45,True,2017-03-15 22:37:45,aledbf,unknown,,closed

If nginx ingress controller is behind some loadbalancer like haproxy, which redirect other port (not 80 or 443) to nginx ingress controller.
So request may looks like http://host:port. But nginx set Host and X-Forwarded-Host as $host, which without port like host. Therefore when real server send redirects to client requests, the url looks like http://host/redirect_url instead of correct url http://host:port/redirect_url.
If using $http_host instead of $host, the correct port will be passed to real server.

**Expectation**
If I were to modify the service `my-echo-svc`, I would expect the GLBC to sync all associated ingresses.

The sync is not triggered.

**Reason**
The function that searches through all ingresses for references to this service was not looking at the default backend.

Fixes #494 - Support HTTPS backend
Fixes #475 - RPS per instance instead of instance group

### Requires:
 - [x] https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/43644 
 - [x] update godeps in ingress repo (compute & k8s)

#### Surfacing Service Annotation
Ideally, the service annotation parsing function is moved here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/api/service/annotations.go . However, the `ingress` repo consumes the `client-go` api and k8s still consumes the local api. @.caesarxuchao mentions that all types will be moved out of k8s and client-go (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44065) in a few weeks. He suggests we place the annotation function locally until things change. 

#### Overview of Changes
- Added ability for controller to create `compute.HttpsHealthCheck`s
- Abstract HTTP/HTTPSHealthCheck with a struct called `HealthCheck`
- Modified `healthchecks` package and interface to separate the instantiation of a health check (`New...`) from creating it in the cloud (`Add...).
- Moved the `GCETranslator` presence from `healthchecks` to `backends`
- Addition/cleanup of fakes and tests for `healthchecks`
- Plumbing of tuple (nodeport int64, encrypted bool) instead of nodeport int64 
- Modified `backends` to create HTTPS `compute.BackendServices` if encrypted=true 

#### Test Cases
- [x] ""Perfect setup"": Create ingress with default backend pointing to a service (port 443), service has port https=443, service annotation has [""https""]
- [x] ""Update ingress port"": Create ingress pointing to service's port 80. Service already has port https=443 and annotation. Update ingress to point to 443
- [x] ""Update service annotation"":Create ingress pointing to service's port 443. Service already has port https=443 but NO annotation.  Set annotation to [""https""]

**Current Behavior**: 
On first sync after start, the controller asserts a certificate with the primary name, and possibly orphans a certificate with the secondary name. On next certificate update, a collision occurs.

**New Behavior**:
Due to the orphaned certificate, some users have two certificates (one with `-1` and one without). Most likely the primary-named certificate is being used, but we can't make that assumption. Therefore, if the controller doesn't know what certificate is being used (on first sync), the code will now inspect the Target HTTPS Proxy for the existing ssl certificate. It'll continue using that certificate until it finds a change in the secret.  If users have two certificates, the controller will attempt deletion of any certificate using the desired name.

The PR also fixes a bug when transitioning from a pre-shared certificate to a secret-based certificate. The controller deletes the pre-shared certificate when it really should ignore it.

Since the backend service already exists in these cases, the controller will attempt to add backends to the existing backend service resource. However, the balancing mode was not being specified and defaulting to UTILIZATION.  If there are existing backend services of type RATE pointing to the same instance groups, the backend-service update will fail. 

New Behavior:
 - Creation of backend-service does NOT include a list of backends. It's only responsible for setting protocol, name, and health check correctly.
 - `edgeHop` now is responsible for adding sets of backends to the backend-service. It has the same RATE-then-UTILIZATION fallback logic as the backend-service creation func had.

The controller has always and will continue to assume that all instance-groups (zones) in a region use the same balancing mode.

I tried to run it like the AWS LoadBalancer Example (https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/tree/master/examples/aws/nginx), but it failed since the service's status didn't advertise any ingress IPs. I fixed that to check for external IPs in the service to and tracked down the usage of the services ingress IP (core/pkg/ingress/status/status.go) and added the external IPs there to.

By default nginx set Host to the upstreams domain name (and not the one passed in) like K8 always forces. This provided an escape hatch to this behavior.

Using gcr.io/google_containers/nginx-ingress-controller:0.9.0-beta.7
the nginx-controller needs to handle leader-election via configmaps.

To perform the leader-election the nginx-controller needs to have the
appropiate RBAC permissions.

Previously to this fix, the following errors occured:

-  `cannot get configmaps in the namespace ""NAMESPACE_PLACEHOLDER"". (get configmaps ingress-controller-leader-nginx)`
- `initially creating leader election record: User ""system:serviceaccount:NAMESPACE_PLACEHOLDER"" cannot create configmaps in the namespace ""NAMESPACE_PLACEHOLDER"". (post configmaps)`

And another error message concerning `update` (I do not have the logs any more)

that was explained in a kubecon session https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iShh33WaoHw

Basically if an ingress controller is scaled to more than 1 the previous behavior was to use the same order of the upstream servers in all the instances. With this PR we randomize the order.

I can't identify a reason why nginx ingress controller pods should be running as root so I dropped privileges to support a strict [container level security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/#container-level-security-context).

In strictly secured kubernetes clusters this pod just ends up on a whitelist of those that run as root and I don't want to do this anymore. Neither should anyone else imo 😄 

### some questions:

1. In order to support `readOnlyRootFilesystem` I've mounted a number of [`emptyDir`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) volumes in the example replication contoller. I don't think this is the best place to keep the pid file but I'm unsure of another solution other than moving it into a non-standard directory like `/etc/nginx/nginx.pid` or something. Help?

1. This should be considered a **major** (read: breaking) change. Does a minor version increment support this change? I expect anyone flipping a minor version without reading the change log would incur downtime on their services while they deal with security controls.

1. Other nits addressed in review comments

I set the following annotations:

```
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: ""http""
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: """"
```

which disable proxy protocol and enable http backend protocol, which cause the ELB to set X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers when communicating with the backend (nginx in this case).

And I have this annotation on the nginx-ingress-controller:

```
      use-proxy-protocol: ""false""
```

However, the X-Forwarded-For header is not being passed along by nginx to its upstream services. This is because when the X-Forwarded-Proto is set to ""https"", the nginx config on line 128 sets $pass_access_scheme to ""https"", which in turn results in $the_x_forwarded_for being set to $proxy_protocol_addr on line 140.

Because I'm not using proxy protocol, $proxy_protocol_addr is unset. However, when using either proxy protocol or X-Forwarded-For, $remote_addr is set correctly by the `real_ip_header` directives on lines 24 and 27.

This pull request solves my problem, though I can't say it doesn't break other configurations. My goal with this PR is to document the issue.

In my test setup I have regular ingress definitions with enabled SSL-redirect, and kube-lego is adding '/.well-known/acme-challenge/...' ingress definitions that at least for a while need to _not_ use ssl-redirection. In kube-lego's log files one can see the problem:

There are a few issues that this relates to which I've tried to include inline.

This is an attempt to resolve #619 and bring the nginx ingress controller more inline with the HTTPIngressPath type as defined in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/apis/extensions/types.go#L704

> Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional ""path"" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/'. If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend.

#646 raises a valid objection to this method of fixing the controller
>Also, if #619 would be fixed by unconditionally enabling regular expressions, even the currently working cases (without rewrite) will break.

Having looked at https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/pull/565#issuecomment-293486981 I believe that the use case where rewrite-target is not used (the use case raised as a potential issue in #646), is being treated as an edge case. It is an edge case I'm hitting though - our apps are aware of their routes, which is why I'm looking to fix the controller so we can use regex routes without enabling the rewrite. 

I'm aware that although enabling this would bring the ingress controller closer to the documented spec, it will also be an unexpected change for existing users of the controller. I'm not sure how this should be handled, but perhaps this change could be wrapped in some kind of annotation to preserve the current behaviour for a limited time, and then the default swapped and the annotation deprecated.

This will also increase the range of location blocks affected by the ordering issues in #495. I'm not sure of a solution there but understand the problem raised.

Politely pinging @ankon @ohmystack @aledbf @himikof and @jurgenweber as interested parties from other PRs/issues related to this. I'd appreciate your feedback so that I can try and craft a solution that can be merged upstream rather than just suiting my own needs.

--

The HTTPIngressPath defines the path as an extended POSIX regex.
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/apis/extensions/types.go#L704

This treats any path passed from the ingress as a regex based location block.
The only exception to this is the / path, which is set as a prefix location
block, this should work as a catchall without affecting other locations defined
using regex location blocks.

It should be noted that there may be some incompatibilities between the spec
and the regex implementation within nginx.",[],1,2017-07-14 20:38:25,2017-10-13 10:18:02,2017-11-22 12:08:44,False,,,dirty,False,closed

IOW the current (without this PR) behavior is try to guess when a secret should be added, which is not working if the secret is used eg on `auth-secret` annotation.

The PR implementation is half of the way to create a facade to find secrets. I added the only missing `ic.syncSecret()` I found on my tests. This might be evolved to a single func that do this job (try/sync/try again). This PR works on my local env.

Things to do:
- [x] Add tests
- [x] Verify manually that this works
- [x] Ensure that resources are GC'd as expected.

Sending it out now to get early feedback.

Update:
Verified that the code works as expected with the following scenarios:

Creating an ingress with gce-multi class, creates expected instance group and deleting the ingress, deletes the ig.
If there is an existing ingress, then creating gce-multi ingress, reuses the existing instance group rather than creating a new one.
There is an existing issue that deleting the ingress does not delete the corresponding named ports which is being tracked in #695.

Will add e2e tests in main repo to automate these tests.

This adds a new field `Target` to the `ingress.Endpoint` type, which references the object providing that Endpoint.

#### Use case

I am writing a controller for Apache 2 and want to provide the ability to enable stickiness in front of Tomcat backends. The standard way to achieve this is to set the `route=` parameter for every *BalancerMember* (equivalent of *upstream.server* in nginx). This parameter must match the value of `jvmRoute=` on the backend.

Without a reference to the Pod providing the endpoint I can't reliably set a route Apache 2 and Tomcat can agree on, like the Pod's name.

When the controller is being started, there's a period where various ingress resources will have their TLS certificate not present.  This is shown by showing the ""default certificate"", for awhile until the controller syncs that secret.

If you have many ingresses ( think like >200 ), it can take minutes for the entire thing to converge.  You can see the error message in the logs:
```""ssl certificate \""some-cert\"" does not exist in local store""```

## Reproduce
0. nginx ingress controller with 1 replica
1. create many ingresses and many updates, the idea is to get the the syncQueue as full as possible.
2. Wait for steady state
3. do ```while true ; do curl https://someplace.with.valid.cer.com/ -m 1s ; done```
4. delete the ingress controller
5. observe many invalid cert errors

## Fix
Since the queue is rate limited, and the only time that certificate syncing is done when the specific ingress of the event is processed.  This leaves a big window of invalid certs as NGINX needs to know the entire state of the system (and indeed it makes sites for them, just no certificates).

When the cert isn't found, I added a syncSecret call so that they can be loaded.  The result is how I would expect now, instead of invalid cert errors we get timeouts until the site is loaded.  This is much more preferable than serving the invalid cert.  And it also converges in about 20s instead of minutes.

## Other ways to fix
I believe this is this way because for the GCE controller, one ingress == one load balancer, but NGINX is many ingress -> one load balancer instance.

1. We could sync all the certificates on start.

We are using a syslog server to store all our access logs which leaves us with two options:
* parsing the access logs out of the container stdout
* modifying the template to specify a different destination (our syslog server)

For performance reason and simplicity we choose to directly send our logs from Nginx to a syslog service. This is working fine by modifying the template. 

However, since it might interest other people to have the log destination customizable, a cleaner solution would be to make it  configurable in the ConfigMap and that's what this PR is about.

This pull-requests adds support for a `access-log-path` field in the Nginx ConfigMap to set a different path than the default one (`/var/log/nginx/access.log`). The value is put as is in the Nginx template, therefore also allowing to configure a syslog server as log destination.

ingress-nginx,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls/1257,https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1257,maxlaverse,Graceful shutdown for Nginx,"## Issue
Nginx is not being gracefully shut down when a Nginx Ingress Controller container is stopped, leading to broken connections. It looks like the `SIGTERM` sent to the controller to stop it is simply forwarded to the Nginx server. 

The problem is that `SIGTERM` means ""Exit as quick as you can"" for Nginx ([Nginx doc](http://nginx.org/en/docs/control.html). For a graceful shutdown we should rather send a `SIGQUIT`.

A solution to this issue is to prevent the Nginx Ingress Controller to forward all the signals it gets to Nginx, allowing us to control what's sent to the Nginx process. When shutting down, the controller would then send a `SIGQUIT` to Nginx. Nginx itself will wait 10secondes (`worker_shutdown_timeout`) for the worker to shutdown.

## Testing
You need a backend exposed on the Ingress that responds slowly. I used one with a 10 secondes response time. Trigger an Ingress deployment and call this slow URL. If your slow URL get an answer before the Nginx is tear down, re-execute it.

We expected this request to be answered to. You should see in the Ingress logs that it's not immediately exiting but waiting for the request to finish. 
Additionally, you can `strace` the Nginx master process to make sure `SIGQUIT` is not being sent instead of `SIGTERM`.

This is a custom ingress controller I wrote which controls [lyft/envoy](https://github.com/lyft/envoy) a programmable C++ L7 proxy. The goal being to get very good http2 support which includes gRPC forwarding. Envoy can also do basic tcp loadbalancing (not implemented in this controller currently) and HTTP/1.1 load balancing.

I'm curious if this sort of contribution (new ingress controller) is being looked for, and if so what sorts of things would be needed to get there. Happy to keep this as my own side project as well, just want to get more of an audience for it and see if it's useful for anyone else. More description about it below. The controller itself is < 1000 lines, most the PR is vendored libraries + some wrapper build scripts.

# Overview
There are three pieces to this ingress. The root is the controller (controller.go) which receives kubernetes ingress controller updates and turns them into the structure needed for envoy. That is then passed to the `DiscoveryService` (discovery.go) which presents the information in the lyft/envoy discovery endpoints
(LDS, RDS, SDS, CDS). The third and final pieces is a process manager for envoy itself which manages configuring and running the lyft/envoy instance.

Every piece is setup so that it'll only start serving / listening once basic routes are setup and in place (so in theory if you add another instance to a cluster you don't hit an ""empty"" envoy and get a bunch of 404 errors)

The need for `DiscoveryService` http service should be going away, as the envoy v2 api gets implemented (https://github.com/lyft/envoy-api#apis). In specific, the ingress controller would implement an ""Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS)"". That would mean the ingress controller could push updates directly to lyft/envoy using gRPC, minimizing update time.

This works for my basic cases. There are definitely many more of the cases that could be implemented (And many more config options which should be controllable via the ingresses themselves). Things like TCP services can also be implemented, just not a feature I'd needed.",[],1,2017-09-01 05:25:55,2017-09-06 23:42:18,2017-09-06 23:42:18,False,,,unknown,,closed

Note that this will mean the ingress controller is unable to get the list of IP address/fqdns where the ingress controller is currently running, and will be unable to update  ingress status with that information. Since this isn't critical to to ingress functioning in all cases, this should be fine, and this configuration is disabled by default, and should only be used when trying to run isolate the ingress controller to it's namespace.

- Deploy an nginx ingress controller
- Create an ingress with the Kubernetes service:
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: ""true""
    kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: ""false""
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  name: kubernetes
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: kubernetes
          servicePort: 443
        path: /
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - example.com
    secretName: tls-example-com
```
- Watch the ingress controller reload nginx over and over again, even if nothing changes

# Why this happens 

The Kubernetes service has `nil` in the address Target, unlike regular services. There's a bug in `Endpoint.Equals()` that returns `false` incorrectly if both endpoints have `nil`. This PR fixes it.

While looking at the other `Equals` functions, I noticed the same bug with `Service`s in two places. I fixed them too, but I haven't checked if there is also a situation that can also cause endless reloads..

1. when inserting event to queue insert current timestamp with it (I will call it eventTimestamp)
2. just before taking any item from queue store current timestamp to a variable (I will call it takeoutTimestamp)
3. after taking item from queue complete all processing as usual. That will take some time but should leave the system synchronized at worst to the time of takeoutTimestamp
4. after synchronization is finished pop events from the queue as long as their eventTimestamp < takeoutTimestamp. That will get rid of all the events for changes that we are sure are already part of running state.

The purpose of me sharing this commit is to share how I'm using the project and possibly spawn conversation.

I was a little surprised to learn that the current SNI routing system implemented by this project is not actually leveraging nginx at all, but is entirely done in golang. I simply was unwilling to connect the current ingress sni routing feature to the Internet. nginx, however, is tried and true and supports SNI routing.

I modeled this change after the TCP l4 stuff that already exists, there's a fair bit of copy-pasta in here.

I also really wanted to leverage the serviceUpstream change that is reasonably recent to the project. My deployment of Kubernetes relies on having persistent connections last as long as possible because TLS handshakes are expensive. During deployments every time the ""pod topology"" changed (i.e. anytime a pod changed status) nginx would reload it's configuration and recycle, ultimately nuking all open connections. Using serviceUpstream we are ~never reloading our nginx config and therefore aren't artificially terminating connections.

Again, I don't expect this code to ever get merged, at least not as-is. I just wanted the maintainers to be able to see how we're using the project.

Since you might be wondering why I would deploy code that I don't want merged upstream: we're expecting to migrate away from SNI routing ~soon. This is a stopgap (prior to this we were SNI routing with haproxy and code that looks like an ingress controller but that predates ingress controllers).

Updating the BackendPool (for backend services) and NodePool (for instance groups) interfaces so that all named ports can be added to an instance group at once. This removes unnecessary API calls where for each named port, we were first fetching the instance group and then setting the named port on it. With this change, we should fetch the instance group once and then set all named ports in a single API call.

Have also removed BackendPool.Sync method since Add does the same now.
Sync was also misleading since it only added backend services and didnt delete them. Add is more explicit.

It's great that the real-ip module has been built in the Ingress. It simplifies the work of a lot of applications by extracting the real client ip automatically for them, avoid the hassle of implementing this is a lot of different languages.

However, the `X-Forwarded-For` header is supposed to contain all the L7 LB or Reverse-proxies that have been crossed, from the client to the application. Of course this information could still be computed by appending `remote_addr` to the `X-Original-Forwarded-For` header on the server side, but it sounds a bit weird.

I would expect the Ingress to behave as any classic reverse-proxy installation, but maybe my ""classic"" picture is wrong. 

On the other hand, if you are only interested in having the real client IP and you extract it from the `x-forwarded-for` header, since you already trust the Ingress it should not be an issue to loose the addresses of other L7 reverse-proxy that have been traversed.",['aledbf'],2,2017-10-06 13:07:23,2017-10-26 23:45:07,2017-10-28 15:38:40,True,2017-10-26 23:45:07,aledbf,unknown,,closed

Return 503 by default when no endpoint is available
```

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PRs changes the backend of a location to be empty per default instead of ""upstream-default-backend"". During template rendering, if the backend of a location is empty, a `503` is returned to the client.

**Which issue this PR fixes**
Currently, if no endpoint is available for an upstream, the backends of locations using that upstream will be set to the default-backend. 

This means that a client might get a `404`under heavy load when no end-points are available. This sound wrong has clients interpret `404` as a valid response meaning the resource doesn't exist. I think that instead of a `404`, the answer should be a `503 Service Unavailable` (*The server is currently unable to handle the request*).

The definition of the default backend from the documentation says it's **a service [for] handling all url paths and hosts the nginx controller doesn't understand.**

I think that perfectly fine and would like not to use it anymore for upstreams without endpoints, which the Nginx Controller knows about but are simply temporarily unavailable.

**Special notes for your reviewer**
I didn't tested the behavior when using a `custom-default-backend`, but I expect it to be unchanged by this PR.

This PR adds option to disable OCSP stapling. While OCSP stapling is a desired behaviour in secure environments, some controllers doesn't have direct Internet Access and face some issues while starting, because NGINX tries to fetch the OCSP stapling from each SSL chain used.

The default behaviour here is to maintain OCSP enabled, so user must ensure ssl-enable-ocsp is 'false' when He/She doesn't want to enable this feature.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: This PR adds new forms to control CORS in a server, allowing user to specify not only if CORS is enabled, but also what are the allowed METHODS, HEADERS, the ORIGIN and credentials behaviour

**Which issue this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close that issue when PR gets merged)*: fixes #1171, fixes #676, fixes #625

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

This PR adds 4 new annotations that allow user to control CORS behaviour in his ingress.

This code inserts some regex validations, as it's not desired that user is allowed to insert values as $nginx_version in allowed methods, as this is going to be returned directly to the final user and can cause an internal information leak, and also Ingress misconfiguration.

This provides more isolation if opentracing is disabled and furthermore opens the door to supporting additional tracers in the future. (For example, Jaeger can be added in once their [C++ tracer](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/228) is available).

It also updates the example to demonstrate how traces can join together spans from separate services.

Additionally, it updates the zipkin library so that it can report traces to Jaeger; though propagation won't work out-of-the-box unless Jaeger clients are explicitly [configured](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go/blob/master/zipkin/README.md#NewZipkinB3HTTPHeaderPropagator) to work with zipkin.",['aledbf'],1,2017-10-24 01:16:04,2017-10-24 21:13:05,2017-10-24 21:13:05,True,2017-10-24 21:13:05,aledbf,unknown,,closed

The real world use case that we have hit is using kube-lego. It creates an ingress to authenticate the domain, and this is usually after other ingress resources are deployed. This doesn't have the server-alias annotations that our other ingress resources do - meaning that the server-alias is dropped entirely.

This uses similar logic to the ServerSnippet annotation to resolve the issue, an alternative approach could be to somehow try and merge the alias annotations, but I'm not sure how best to approach that.

The PR #1489 added a new ConfigMap option (`compute-full-forwarded-for`) that allows us to compute a full `X-Forwarded-For` header as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239, section 5.2. With this option enabled, the Nginx Ingress adds the remote IP to the list of IPs (empty or not) of the `X-Forwarded-For` header (header name configurable). This is fine for requests proxied using the HTTP protocol.

When using the PROXY protocol to forward the request to the Nginx Ingress (with `use-proxy-protocol=true` in the Ingress Controller ConfigMap), with the current implementation the remote IP is added to the list, which is the L4 proxy IP. As discussed in #1489, this is not the expected behavior as:
* we loose the address of the client that connected to the L4 proxy
* L4 proxies act on the TCP level and are supposed to be transparent, meaning they don't appear in the `X-Forwarded-For` header

This PR will change the behavior of the Ingress when `compute-full-forwarded-for` and `use-proxy-protocol` are set to true, and adds the client IP as sent in the PROXY protocol to the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
 
 **Example with `compute-full-forwarded-for` enabled**
With `use-proxy-protocol=false`, for a client (ip 1.2.3.4) that makes a request to a L7 load-balancer (ip 10.0.0.1) in front of the Ingress, the `X-Forwarded-For` received by the back-end is `1.2.3.4, 10.0.0.1` (unchanged)

With `use-proxy-protocol=true`, for a client (ip 1.2.3.4) that makes a request to a L4 load-balancer (ip 10.0.0.1) in front of the Ingress, the `X-Forwarded-For` received by the back-end would be `1.2.3.4` with this PR. It would have been `10.0.0.1` without.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: This PR implements selective logging based on request HTTP status. This is implemented the same as `skip-access-log-urls` in that it allows the configuration of HTTPs statuses for which requests should not be logged. This is very useful for high volume ingress where turning access logging completely off is undesirable, but not logging things like 2xx and 3xx responses is desirable.

Unlike `skip-access-log-urls`, the argument comma delimited arguments to `skip-access-log-http-statuses` in the ConfigMap are treated as case-sensitive regular expressions in the nginx map (i.e. they are not simply treated as strings).

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
This was built on top of master/HEAD and there appears to be a bug releated to `ssl-dh-param` there. I had to remove `ssl-dh-param` from my ConfigMap to get this build to not crash on startup.

Also note that an event unit test fails with a race condition, but this happens on master/HEAD without my changes as well.

I believe I have implemented this and the required modifications to the template so that additional `skip-access-log` features, should they be introduced, can be added cleanly.",[],1,2017-11-09 20:27:44,2018-05-10 16:24:42,2018-05-10 16:24:42,False,,,dirty,False,closed

This is changes the patch to actually do an `add` operation for the providers that require the `--publish-service` argument (e.g. https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/deploy#aws). It also formats the JSON to be a bit more readable instead of a single line.

We want to be following best practices! https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**:
Fixes #1509 and corrects #1910 

**Release note**:
```release-note
action required: Changed the names of default Nginx ingress prometheus metrics. If you are scraping default Nginx ingress metrics with prometheus the metrics changes are as follows
nginx_active_connections_total -> nginx_connections_total{state=""active""}
nginx_accepted_connections_total -> nginx_connections_total{state=""accepted""}
nginx_handled_connections_total -> nginx_connections_total{state=""handled""}
nginx_current_reading_connections_total -> nginx_connections{state=""reading""}
nginx_current_writing_connections_total -> nginx_connections{state=""writing""}
current_waiting_connections_total -> nginx_connections{state=""waiting""}
```

I'm not sure if we would like to remove the `current_` prefix from the gauges if that's implied without some kind of total prefix, but I think this fixes the issues @discordianfish and @brancz had with #1910. 

Side note: does this need some kind of release note _action_ to notify people using these metrics since it could break their monitoring/alerting?

The changes done in https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1926 resulted in Nginx ignoring `$http_host` and `$http_x_forwarded_host` variables when setting HTTP Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers for the upstream. It broke applications that rely on X-Forwarded-Host header.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

pull the IP from proxy_protocol for HTTP and HTTPS. The change ensures if we enable SSL passthrough, IP whitelist will still work for HTTP and HTTPS.

This attempts to fix https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2100

In summary I have:
  - Moved the geoip data to `/etc/nginx/geoip`
  - Added Filesystem watchers on each of the files in that directory.

Things I don't like:
  - I've hard coded the files in `/etc/nginx/geoip`, it'd be nice to probably just enumerate the files in that directory and watch them all (in case they change name/are added/removed)
  - I've probably wrote terrible golang, this is literally my first golang change PR ever - so I apologise!

I've tested it on my controller, this was me modifying each file:

It uses now the value coming from:

sysctl fs.file-max 

However this causes problem when the hosts also sets value using ulimit in the file `/etc/security/limits.conf` 

So when running the container in **non priviledged** mode, it is not possible to change during during the pod initialization.

```
initContainers:
- name: init-myservice
  image: quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.11.0
  command: ['sh', '-c', 'sysctl -w fs.file-max=10000;']
```

So for example the host would have 200000 limit for sysctl fs.file-max 
Then we have 10000 for the ulimit [defined in the /etc/security/limits.conf]

With this values the container try set the maxOpenFiles to something like

`maxOpenFiles := (fileMax / wp) - 1024
`
This would fail and generate an error in the log

` 44#44: setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, 48976) failed (1: Operation not permitted)   
`
As the maximum value in my case should be 10000.

So I guess that the best option would be to set to have 2 max values [one coming from the kernel the other coming from ulimit] and the minimum value should be choosen.

This will still allow to customize the values on **initcontainer** when running in priviledged mode.",[],1,2018-02-28 14:23:51,2018-02-28 14:32:37,2018-02-28 20:59:37,False,,,unknown,,closed

ingress-nginx,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls/2174,https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2174,ElvinEfendi,Live Nginx configuration update without reloading,"Requires https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2172 to be merged first and published the new Nginx image.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
The PR implements live configuration update for Nginx upstreams/k8s endpoints. That means every time you deploy your app Nginx won't be reloaded. This is very important when you are front-ending many applications behind a single deployment of ingress-nginx and those app gets deployed frequently and have significant traffic.

I've mainly focused on laying out proper foundation for further development of live Nginx (re)configuration feature in ingress-nginx. The PR implements only Round Robin algorithm but can easily be extended to support more. I have another PR at https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2167 to configure load balancing algorithm per ingress, that configuration will be used by Lua code as well to decide which LB algorithm to use for a given app(namespace/service).

The feature can be enabled by using `--enable-dynamic-configuration` command line flag. If you wanna see more Lua logs you can also set `error-log-level` to `info` to see what it does on endpoints changes.

In order to avoid JSON decoding in the request path, for every Nginx worker I spin up a periodic function that reads raw configuration from a shared Lua dictionary and decodes it into local cache per worker. Then balancer uses its local cache to get the list of endpoints and other backend configuration for given namespace/service.

**If you want to test** you can use `index.docker.io/elvinefendi/nginx-ingress-controller:0.0.1`

**Next steps**: Setup a testing framework for Lua code, add support for EWMA and more LB algorithms, add support for live update of secrets by using `certificate_by_lua`

**What this PR does / why we need it**: Allow referencing TLS secret from other namespaces. When TLS secret referred to when creating an ingress is of pattern `<namespace>/<secretName>`, ingress controller will check the namespace specified rather than ingress' namespace for secret.

`golint` enforces good practices for writing Go code, therefore it makes sense to run checks on test packages as well. Since ""should not use dot imports"" is the only warning we really want to ignore (`ginkgo` imports), it is simple enough to exclude these warnings from the `golint` output.

Ideally this should be configurable per ingress, but having a generally configurable option is also better than hardcoding its value.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This PR is an extension of https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2174 which enables optional dynamic configuration via the `--enable-dynamic-configuration` flag. This allows NGINX upstreams/K8 endpoints can be updated without reloading NGINX.

The purpose of this PR is to add EWMA (exponential weighted moving average) as a configurable load balancing algorithm. EWMA load balancing uses a moving average of the roundtrip time of an upstream in order to determine where to forward a request. Using EWMA has the potential to decrease queueing delays and response time for ends users.

If the origin ingress rule has no field `path`, the default value will be an empty string which will cause issues when rendering template as other place will use `/` as the default value.
Set the default value of path to `/` when retrieve ingress rules from api-server. 

This fix may also fix some hidden bugs that related to the default empty path. 
e.g.
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/internal/ingress/controller/template/template.go#L728
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/internal/ingress/controller/template/template.go#L616

Both of them compare path with origin ingress path, if there is no path field in ingress rules it will generate wrong nginx config.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Currently, for each host, if the first (lowest resourceVersion) ingress configuration does not contain a TLS secret, the default certificate is set. This causes the controller to ignore newer ingress configurations that may reference a TLS secret.

This change allows configurations, where multiple ingress configurations exist for a host, with only one of them containing a TLS secret, to work more reliably.

For detailed information please refer to the referenced issue. The problem is that `proxy_upstream_name` gets overridden with a wrong value when external authentication is enabled and therefore requests fail when dynamic configuration is also enabled because Lua can not pick the correct backend.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

When dynamic configuration is enabled, `ngx.var.proxy_upstream_name` is used to get the current backend (stored on the NGINX configuration) in the balancer lua module. This variable is created in `buildUpstreamName()` in /internal/ingress/controller/controller.go. 

PROBLEM: Backends stored in the NGINX configuration do not use the convention `sticky-<upstream-name>` when dynamic configuration is enabled. If `ngx.var.proxy_upstream_name` uses the sticky convention this will cause a 500 internal server error. 

This PR prevent buildUpstreamName from using the naming convention `sticky-<upstream-name>` when dynamic configuration is enabled **prevent 500 internal server errors**.

# **What this PR does / why we need it**:

This PR adds **session affinity through cookies** to the lua custom load balancing module when dynamic configuration is enabled. 

This implementation mimics the current implementation used for sticky sessions in `kubernetes/ingress-nginx` when dynamic configuration is **not** enabled ([k8 documentation on sticky sessions](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/examples/affinity/cookie/README.md))

# **Which issue this PR fixes**: 
N/A

# **Special notes for your reviewer**:

## Test coverage
Two new unit tests were added in `test/e2e/lua/dynamic_configuration.go`. These tests cover dynamically enabled session affinity when an ingress is defined in one two ways (See A and B below). Additionally, the pre-existing tests in `test/e2e/annotations/affinity.go` ensure that session affinity still works when dynamic configuration is disabled. 

A. Default backend
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: testsvc
    servicePort: 80
```
_Note: Session affinity will **not** be enabled when using method A. This is because the session affinity annotation being appended to an upstream is dependent on the location. (see code [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/internal/ingress/controller/controller.go#L507-L509))_

B. Using Rules
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        backend:
          serviceName: s1
          servicePort: 80
```

## Low Level Implementation Details
#### **`kubernetes/ingress-nginx` implementation**
1. If the [affinity annotation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/annotations.md#session-affinity) is set to ""cookie"" on an ingress then a `sticky-{{ $upstream.name }}` upstream is defined in the nginx template (see [code](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/385368990cd678d08fe0b30fd8f087cfaad91a19/rootfs/etc/nginx/template/nginx.tmpl#L350-L352))
2. The [nginx-sticky-module-ng](https://bitbucket.org/nginx-goodies/nginx-sticky-module-ng) is used to handle sticky upstreams 
>A nginx module to add a sticky cookie to be always forwarded to the same upstream server...
>When the sticky module can't apply, it switchs back to the classic Round Robin Upstream or returns a ""Bad Gateway"" (depending on the no_fallback flag).
3. The [nginx template proxy_pass](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/385368990cd678d08fe0b30fd8f087cfaad91a19/rootfs/etc/nginx/template/nginx.tmpl#L986) is built in [template.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/adf12fced1d9db98c767554adff1c7895e50ee24/internal/ingress/controller/template/template.go#L348-L349); if the backend is sticky then it will return `sticky-{{ $upstream.name }}` and use the upstream defined in step i.

#### **New custom Lua implementation**
1. In the lua [balancer module](https://github.com/Shopify/ingress/blob/c1937876ed35406748ae996bd59dc5a7b40017d3/rootfs/etc/nginx/lua/balancer.lua#L44-L50) the session [affinity annotation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/annotations.md#session-affinity) with the value ""cookie"" is checked for
2. If it exists, then a cookie named by the [session-cookie-name annotation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/annotations.md#cookie-affinity) value (default is ""route"") is checked for
3. If the cookie:
    - **Does NOT exist:** 
        1. The round robin algorithm is used to determine the upstream to forward to *
        2. The upstream is converted to an `<IP>:<Port>` string and hashed using the [session-cookie-hash annotation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/annotations.md#cookie-affinity) value (default is ""md5"") 
        3. A new cookie is set with [session-cookie-name annotation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/annotations.md#cookie-affinity) as the name and the hash as the value
        4. The upstream is stored in the shared lua dictionary named `sticky-sessions`
            - `sticky-sessions` stores the following key value pairs: **
                - _key_: The hash of the cookie
                - _value_: The raw `<IP>:<Port>` string of the upstream to be forwarded to
        5. The IP and port of the upstream are set as the current peer
    - **DOES exist**
        1. The stored cookie is looked up in the shared lua dictionary, `sticky-sessions`**
        2. The IP and port returned from the dictionary lookup are checked to determine if they're still routable
        3. If the IP and port:
            - **ARE routable**
                - The IP and port of the upstream are set as the current peer
            - **Are NOT routable**
                - Follow procedure in Step 3: Does NOT exist


*Any of custom load balancing algorithms can be to balance with session affinity. Defaulting to round robin is just to be consistent with nginx-sticky-module-ng used for session affinity when dynamic configuration is not enabled.

The background check for missing secrets leads to unnecessarily delayed synchronization of SSL secrets.

Illustrated scenario:

1. An Ingress object with a reference to a Secret is created, the Secret does not exist yet
2. A config synchronization is triggered, all sections supposed to use the Secret are ignored
3. The Secret is created, but nothing happens until the next background check

This PR improves the tracking of Ingress->Secret references using a new `ObjectRefMap` interface. At all times the map contains an up-to-date list of Secrets referenced by one or more Ingresses, including Secrets that do not exist within the cluster.

All EventHandlers for Secret resources perform a lookup in the map in order to determine whether the object that triggered the event is being referenced, in which case:

- annotations for matching Ingresses are extracted again
- secrets for matching Ingresses are synced again (possibly leading to new a config synchronization in case the content of the Secret differs)

The result is a more immediate feedback to changes that does not rely on arbitrary delays.",['aledbf'],3,2018-04-13 12:08:50,2018-04-13 15:32:00,2018-04-13 15:37:56,True,2018-04-13 15:32:00,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Integration with the [linkerd service mesh](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/blob/master/README.md) requires customization of the `proxy_pass` address in the nginx template. This PR adds the following annotations to allow users to customize the `proxy_pass` address:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-pass-address: string
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-pass-port: string
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-to-local-node: bool
```

The `proxy-pass-address` and `proxy-pass-port` annotations allow users to set `proxy_pass` to a linkerd address, so that traffic is passed to the service mesh as in the [basic nginx-linkerd example](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd-examples/blob/master/k8s-daemonset/k8s/nginx.yml).

If `proxy-to-local-node` is `true`, the `proxy_pass` address will be set to the value parsed by `os.Getenv(""NODE_NAME"")`, which can be set to the name of the node using the downward API. This is useful when running linkerd as a daemonset, ensuring that traffic reaching an nginx ingress controller pod will be forwarded to the linkerd pod running on the same node; when using linkerd in a linker-to-linker configuration with TLS enabled, this ensures traffic does not leave the node unencrypted.",['aledbf'],3,2018-04-13 14:05:02,2018-11-12 06:31:10,2018-11-12 06:31:10,False,,,dirty,False,closed

1. Problems with how the nginx-configuration configMap are updated in the e2e tests include: making the e2e test runs unreliable due to state leakage, and given that developers use the same controller deployment to test things during development - this makes the development workflow somewhat unpredictable as well. 
2. [The nginx-configuration configMap](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/deploy/configmap.yaml) used by the nginx controller within the ingress-nginx namespace is updated and _toggled back_ during several e2e tests. This PR moves that code up into the e2e/framework to make it easier to reuse across these tests. 
3. Currently, in e2e tests, developers attempt to _reset_ the configMap to an initial state in the AfterEach handler, like so: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/361e53ffa9d05f3ffdb4995ec7a6f34a1bf68115/test/e2e/settings/no_auth_locations.go#L63, however after running the e2e tests, if you were starting with an empty configMap, and then ran the no_auth_locations test for example - you would be left with configMap data different from when you started. 
4. This PR attempts to address this by introducing helper methods to make it easier to reset the configMap to its initial state. 

TL;DR: The way the nginx-configuration configMap is updated and _reset_ in the e2e tests leaks state! Issa fix.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
* After talking with (my close personal friend) @ElvinEfendi, we realized that maybe a better alternative approach would ultimately be to decouple the e2e tests from the developer workflow, by having the e2e tests spawn an ephemeral ingress deployment for the lifecycle of the tests - similarly to how the backends are spawned just for the lifecycle of the tests. E.g. [EchoDeployment](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/f732b4ea2ffe3741c3f04699f6ba9cd1d53c3859/test/e2e/framework/echo.go#L33)
* However, this is a step in the right direction, and we could always follow up with a PR with the ideas mentioned above.

Let me know what you guys think - happy to iterate or rework this.

The prometheus exporter translates this into a label with the same value.  I use a datadog agent to read the prometheus metrics, which turns the label into a ""tag"", but strips out characters which the datadog service cannot accept, including `*`.  This means the label value `*` becomes an empty string tag value.   

So for example the prometheus metric `nginx_requests_total{ingress_class=""nginx"",namespace="""",server_zone=""*""}` is turned into a datadog metric named `nginx.requests_total`, with the tags `ingress_class:nginx`, `namespace:`, and `server_zone:`.

This isn't so bad, except the same thing happens to metrics for the server zone which includes (I believe) the default backend and metrics server, labeled `server_zone=""_""`.  So I have different metrics numbers with the same tags, getting sent to datadog all the time, which makes monitoring seemingly impossible.  

The workaround I've done is to create a custom `nginx.conf` template exactly like the normal one, except with one additional line: `vhost_traffic_status_display_sum_key total;`  And maybe someday I'll just use prometheus instead of datadog.

ingress-nginx,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls/2368,https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2368,antoineco,[aggregate] Fix typos across codebase,"#### What is this for?

I suggest using this aggregate (editable by maintainers) as an effort to reduce the number of PRs dedicated to fixing (usually) small amounts of typos across the codebase, and therefore keep the commit history clean while preserving commits ownership by contributors.

I will myself try to spare time within the next few days and go through comments and documentation pages in order to fix as many typos as possible. I will keep aggregating new purely typo-related issues and PRs here.

#### Procedure

```
$ git fetch origin pull/<ID>/head:tmp-typo
$ git cherry-pick tmp-typo
```

Commits by the same author will be squashed before merging.

A first step to remove hardcoded `time.Sleep` from e2e tests

Changes:
- Before each test, a new namespace is created and a new ingress controller is deployed
- In case of validation errors, we get the Full Stack Trace
- The SlowSpecThreshold was adjusted to 20 seconds (default is 5)
- Now it is possible to just run `make e2e-test` against minikube (previous upload of the docker image)

This PR adds clarification regarding using `--enable-ssl-passthrough` flag if external load balances are used.

I've plunged into the [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2354) with Go-based SSL proxying done by ingress-controller. Finally i found out that i can safely disable built-in SSL proxying, if i already have proxy protocol enabled on load balancer.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Setting up the development environment is quite time consuming and somewhat confusing. This script creates a quick command that will allow MacOS developers to set up their quickly by automating the following tasks:

~~1. Stop and uninstall minikube~~
~~2. Install minikube version 0.25.0~~
3. Start minikube
4. Dep ensure to get `vendor/` dependencies
5. Build the local ingress controller container
6. Install kubectl
7. Deploy the controller & update the image

**Which issue this PR fixes**: N/A

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

~~Minikube versions > 0.25.0 enable RBAC on the cluster. This will cause the e2e-tests to fail. Therefore a suitable development environment requires version 0.25.0 or less.~~

This happens whenever external auth service returns cookies and other headers that exceed the default proxy buffer (4Kb). The configmap option `proxy-buffer-size` is completely ignored and its `proxy_buffer_size` equivalent is not propagated to the auth `location`.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
The current template generates upstreams without setting the path parameter on the sticky config. This leads to a new cookie beeing generated whenever the user requests a different path from the ingress. This change sets the path parameter whenever the backend contains only a single location. It falls back to the previous behaviour (not setting the path parameter) if multiple ingress rules exist for the same backend (leading to multiple locations for the backend).

Requests to the HTTPS port will hang indefintely under the following conditions:

1. --tls-passthrough is enabled
2. proxy protocol is enabled in the configmap
3. The incoming request does not include the PROXY header and just sends a request to open a TCP connection. This can occur if you are using, say an AWS NLB to bring traffic to the controller and do not have proxy protocol enabled because the current proxy-protocol library used by this ingress controller does not support v2. https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/vendor/github.com/armon/go-proxyproto/README.md

Since enabling proxy protocol support is a global setting and cannot be changed for HTTP and HTTPs independently, this causes users of the NLB to need to disable proxy protocol for HTTPS to avoid errors on header processing if they have tls-passthrough enabled.

**Which issue this PR fixes**:

The go-proxyproto library specifically recommends settings a deadline if you call before call RemoteAddr() before calling Read() or it could cause the thread to sit in i/o wait if the proxy headers never come through. This can happen just due to network disruptions when a client is sending a request without the proxy headers and the rest of the request never makes it through.

This PR adds a configurable timeout/deadline value, defaulting 5 seconds to prevent this from occurring. I should also note that the /healthz does not currently check for the liveness of the proxy pass process, so when this bug does occur, it will not self heal just with the kube liveness probe.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

The bug is reproduced by running the ingress controller in master with the following settings

cli:
`--enable-tls-passthrough`

configMap:
`use-proxy-protocol:
true`

kubectl port-forward directly to a/the pod on port 443. Curls against the pod should return the default backend. To produce the bug. Telnet to the pod on 443 and do not put additional input. If you curl on a seperate terminal, might take a few attempts, you will see that the curl request will hang until clientside timeout. This is resolved by closing the telnet process or restarting the pod.

Consistent hashing algorithm is not guaranteed to choose a different upstream for a different key - we could have sent several requests with different keys and assert at least one of them ends up getting proxied to a different upstream but even that would theoretically be flaky (I've done that too in first commit for visibility but IMO it is OK to just ignore that case).

Fixes incorrect description for `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough` annotation that was introduced by my other [change](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2377).

User actually needs flag `--enable-ssl-passthrough` anyway if he wants to use ssl passthru. In my [initial change](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2377) i incorrectly assumed (and missed while testing) that only thing TCPProxy does is PROXY protocol header. Now i see that it's also does [SNI](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/f92f5f80e4fe6fbd08565affb509bed914163362/internal/ingress/controller/tcp.go#L71). This means `--enable-ssl-passthrough` always required, despite PROXY protocol in load balancer.

I also created [feature request](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2539) to do SNI by nginx and not by ingress-controller.

My initial [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2354) was that Go routine (with TCPProxy) crashed silently on all replicas.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR refactors balancer logic to be more modular, extensible and testable. It also fixes bug with returning 503 by using `rewrite_by_lua` handler. Now balancer.lua has four public methods namely `init_worker()`, `rewrite()`, `balance()`, and `log()` which get called in their respective phase.

`init_worker()` function kicks in when Nginx worker starts. It calls private `sync_backends()` function that takes care of initializing, updating and deleting respective balancer instances for the backends. `sync_backends()` also gets called periodically in every 1 second to keep the backend balancers in sync for the given Nginx worker.

`rewrite()` function takes care of returning 503 when there's no balancer for the backend current request corresponds to.

`balancer()` gets the balancer instance for given request/backend and calls `:balance()` function which executes the respective load balancing algorithm and returns `host`, `port` pair. `balancer()` then takes care of calling Nginx API function to set the upstream peer.

`log()` function gets the balancer instance for given request/backend and calls `:after_balance()`. Currently only EWMA algorithm implements `after_balance()`. This is useful when the LB algorithm needs to store some stats related to i.e response times or response status code etc.

--

With this PR if someone wants to introduce a new load balancing algorithm they can create the respective Lua module in `balancer/` folder and register it in `balancer.lua`. Every new load balancing module has to implement at least `new(backend)`, `sync(backend)` and `balance()`. Optionally they can implement `after_balance()` as well.

--

Once this PR gets merged I'll add more unit tests which will most likely make some of the related e2e tests weak enough that we can just delete.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
The [add_header](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header) directive depends on the returned status code. If `always` is not set it can lead to unintentional header leaks when used as `key: """"`.

Changing the default behavior to `always` add make a more robust config.
This is similar to how `proxy-set-header` works.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
By default ingress-nginx configures Nginx to retry next upstream _indefinitely_ for any of `error timeout invalid_header http_502 http_503 http_504`. This is a bit extreme and it potentially hides important errors. The PR changes the defaults to be more restrictive. Note that these values can still be customized per ingress.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

For the sake of reducing downtime and risk of updating a service, we usually adopt Blue-Green Deployment or Gray Deployment that ensures the coexistence of the old and new service version. We can shift partial traffic to the new service by weight percentage or some extra routing rules, such as some keyword from cookie or request header and so on. And nginx ingress controller is served as the traffic entrypoint for all cluster services, it should offer the capability of traffic management.

This PR sets proper paths in ARM builds of ingress-nginx for liblua.so and lua_package_cpath. 

Without this fix, nginx.tmpl is always invalid for ARM devices due to assumption of `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.1/?.so;` as a valid path regardless of platform architecture. Similarly, build.sh assumes that `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so` always exists, but this is not true for all platforms.   

**Explanation**:
[nginx.tmpl](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/rootfs/etc/nginx/template/nginx.tmpl) is used to create the default nginx.conf for the nginx-ingress-controller.  As-is, this file references lua packages in a hard-coded platform-specific path `usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.1/?.so;`.  As a result, lua packages installed via clean-install were not being found on ARM builds as this path does not exist.  On ARM, the search path for lua packages installed via clean-install should be `usr/lib/rm-linux-gnueabihf/lua/5.1/?.so;` .  

This explains why cjson was already being installed via clean-install, but not found on ARM per commentary by @ElvinEfendi  on #2588.  The fix that was applied in #2588  installs lua-cjson in `/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1` (via luarocks) instead of `/usr/lib/linux-gnueabihf/lua/5.1` (via clean-install) which gets picked up in nginx.tmpl due to inclusion of the search path `/usr/local/lib/lua/?.so;.`  The clean-install method was already sufficient but nginx.tmpl was improperly referencing one of the search paths.    In summary, nginx.tmpl was the real culprit of #2547.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This PR:
1. Adds a UDP collector that listens to UDP messages from `monitor.lua` and exposes them on `/metrics` endpoint using prometheus client.
2. Removes VTS collector. 

**Why do we need this PR?** 

With the dynamic mode introduced a couple of releases ago, the load balancing is handled in LUA. This means there is no upstream section in the generated nginx.conf, there is only one used to switch to LUA. In this scenario, the VTS module is useless because the stats only contains information about this upstream without any context about the traffic. Additionally, by using the VTS module it is not possible to add custom variables to the stats, such as information about the namespace, ingress rule, and service (something available as NGINX variable).

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Fix nginx config file test error when found no active service endpoints. For example:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-example
spec:
  rules:
  - host: www.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: not-exist-service
          servicePort: 80
```
Then the new nginx configuration file generated by ingress controller contains a proxy_pass that its upstream does not exist.

Setting it to `true` corresponds to the current ingress behavior.

It is set to `false` by default. **this is a breaking change**, but IMO it's the right thing to do if we follow the ""secure by default"" principle:

- If the default is `true`, it might lead to vulnerable installations: If it's set to true in a scenario when it shouldn't (direct port forwarding, L3 load balancers) the config is vulnerable to source IP spoofing. However, since everything appears to work correctly, the user probably won't notice, and will end up vulnerable in production.
- If the default is `false`, it'll just cause incorrect behavior if it's wrong. The user is likely to notice he's getting incorrect source IPs and will set it to `true`. At no point the user is vulnerable to spoofing.

The new Prometheus metrics implementatation is great... however, it may
create a lot of metric contexts in prometheus, because some of the
reported tags have a very high cardinality on common production systems.

In particular the `remote_address`, `real_ip_address`, `remote_user` and - in
many cases - `path` tags' cardinality grows along with the number of
IPs/users connecting to our clusters and the number of API resources
we have on our clusters (when specified via URI).

My prometheus servers crashed a couple of times this weekend and I realized
earlier in the evening that this was due to the volume of metrics I was receiving
from my nginx ingress controllers.

This commit therefore offers to exclude some prometheus tags via a CLI
flag, with default values for the tags mentionned above (of course that's something
I'd be happy to change if you don't want to ""break compatibility"" with the current 
metric tag format but I thought using ""saner"" defaults may be better).

I didn't open an issue for that but that can easily be done if required :)

**Context:**
- we only have a list of endpoints to remove from the metrics
- we need all the labels to delete a metric

**Process:**
- after a reload and before replacing the running model, create a list of endpoints not available anymore
- use prometheus registry to gather the current set of metrics
- iterate the metrics
- for each metric obtained in the previous step delete prometheus metric

Replaces #2716 

**TODO:**
- [x] remove metrics when ingress rules are removed
- [x] check we have a request count metric
- [x] tests
- [x] check ssl expiration metrics are present only if we have SSL certificate configured
- [x] create interface and wrap collectors
- [x] remove prometheus.MustRegister from init() methods
- [x] use a custom prometheus registry
- [x] remove goroutine creation from collectors
- [ ] add flag to allow disable the prometheus metrics
- [x] add metric for configuration checksum

On every backend configuration reload, Prometheus collectors for
request metrics (bearing the `upstream_ip` tag) are being recreated to
avoid keeping on exposing metrics for dead upstreams on the `/metrics`
endpoint.

Also, we changed the structure of the collector.go file into a
singleton (to make it possible for the ingress controller to ask for a
Prometheus collector reset on these metrics on config. reloads).

**Why we need it**:

When an upstream pod dies (because of a scale down operation, a rolling
upgrade...), metrics associated with this given pod via the `upstream_ip`
tag remain exposed on the `/metrics` endpoints. This cause three
undesireable effects:
- Analyzing these metrics on Prometheus/Grafana can be impossible:
  queries easily tend to time out or frontends tend too freeze
  because too many timeseries are returned
- Payloads periodically fetched by Prometheus can get very big over
  time on production clusters, which also make them more expensive to
  ingest and store

  memory leak.

**Which issue this PR fixes**:
I didn't open an issue for that and filed a PR directly, but that can be done if required.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
If the ""singleton"" design pattern bothers you (because you were intending to instantiate multiple collectors in the future for some reason), or anything else. I'll be happy to promptly refactor the PR.

**What could we break**:
On infrastructure where the config would be reloaded at a high pace (higher than the Prometheus `scrape_interval`, we introduce discontinuities in our timeseries. It's something that Prometheus `rate()` (and similar) function handle very well. However, if backend reconfiguration frequency is higher that the Prometheus `scrape_interval`, it's possible that we get incoherent.
If so, we may just rate-limit the metric flushing operation to 1 every ""user-configurable amount of time"" (ex. 5 minutes). As long as this time is superior to a couple of Prometheus `scrape_interval`s, we should be totally fine :) 

**PR Status**:
The PR compiles, and his being tested on our staging infrastructure. So far so good :) 
I'll try it on our production clusters today and compare the size of the payloads of the `/metrics` endpoint before and after the upgrade and also check that discontinuities during intense scale-in operations",[],1,2018-07-02 07:00:41,2018-07-02 13:29:22,2018-07-02 13:29:22,False,,,unknown,,closed

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

I found it confusing to see the helm after the list of generic steps (should I run `helm install ...` after I followed the steps above or is it a different way?). Also, the verification and version detection steps don't work with helm chart due to different app label (`ingress-nginx` vs `nginx-ingress`) and namespace. 

This change does two things:
1. Separate helm installation from generic installation and provide version detection commands that work for helm
2. Rename `Custom Service Provider Deployment` to `Provider Specific Steps` and fix the broken link while doing so.

We have introduced dynamic backend configuration feature at https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2174 on 18th March and since then improved the initial implementation and fixed bugs. Several people/companies have already been successfully running ingress-nginx with this feature enabled. In this mode ingress-nginx also provides a more advanced load balancing algorithm that can be enabled using `load-balance` (set to `ewma`) configmap setting or annotation. However `least_conn` and `ip_hash` are not available in this mode. Also note https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2662.

For an idea of how many reloads this feature can skip check out the following graph (EDT time):
<img width=""1325"" alt=""screen shot 2018-07-16 at 9 43 42 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1150042/42792049-87907194-8941-11e8-81a3-26f93aa53ef8.png"">
As you can see during work hours on average 25 reloads every 5m. Note that this ingress-nginx instance has more than 500 upstreams and the app behind gets deployed dozens of times during working hours.

Currently we concat address and port using `:` and the `balance` interface takes care of splitting. But when the IP address is i.e `::1` then this breaks the whole thing. After encoding it becomes something like `::1:8080` where `8080` is a port. And when you decode it you get `ip = nil`, `port = "":1:8080""`. The PR changes this unnecessary encoding/decoding first. But even that is not enough for supporting IPv6 endpoints because with that change we would be doing something like `balancer.set_current_upstream(""::1:8080"")`, and this is incorrect because when given with port, IPv6 addresses must be wrapped in square brackets. This is why the PR also introduces a preprocessing step in `sync_backend` where the helper function rewrites every IPv6 address into `[IPv6]`.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Prometheus' default `scrape_interval` is `1m`, see [prometheus doc](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/), making `irate(mymetrics{}[1m])` not return any data with the default `scrape_interval`. 

In order to make this Grafana dashboard as easy to use as possible I think it should work out of the box with the Prometheus defaults, therefore I suggest to switch `1m` for `2m` but other values could also be useful.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

We need to assign the correct datasources in the grafana dashboard.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

I have submitted two different commits. The first commit (2a3f03c) solves the problem of using default datasource which doesn't make sense in my opinion since in other parts of the file we use prometheus (like [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/82bfcb0337942bebcb27c79b1a83c759a714a669/deploy/grafana/dashboards/nginx.yaml#L44-L56)). This leads to wrong data inputs and in addition to wrong visualization of the nginx metrics.

The second commit d1a38c2 fixes a bug which shows on the right corner of grafana the following message.

> Annotation Query Failed
> Datasource named Prometheus was not found

Suggestions of tiny improvements for things I run often. I though some may make sense for the rest of us as well:

* Make the compiler actually use the [Go cache](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Build_and_test_caching) (Go [1.10+](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10)) by avoiding full rebuilds (remove `-a` flag). Speeds up builds quite a lot on modest hardware.
* Make build flags parameterizable: `GOBUILD_FLAGS` variable, defaults to `-v` to show the build progress. Also makes the wait more meaningful than a long blank on modest hardware.
* Print main build steps (""+ Building bin/amd64/..."", ""+ Copying to temp dir..."")
* ~~Move build of `ingress-nginx:build` image to a `build-image` make target, mainly to be able to log that step in the right order.~~
* Rename make `clean` target to `clean-container`, because it's really what it does.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Adding custom configuration to the main context of the nginx config file is currently only possible by providing a custom template. IMO doing so should be considered a last resort since it could make the upgrade process more painful. This PR introduces the `main-snippet` ConfigMap option which enables addition of custom settings to the main context of the nginx config file.

**Release note**:
```release-note
Adds `main-snippet` ConfigMap option which enables adding custom settings to the main section of the nginx config file.
```

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
Didn't see any tests for similar functions (e.g. `http-snippet`). I assume this can be verified in the e2e tests but I wasn't entirely sure if that's the proper place to test it.

Adds an annotation option for setting the proxy_http_version variable.
Since 0.10.0 ; https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1787 was actually a breaking change for us as the proxy_http_version became hardcoded to 1.1 in the template  which was 1.0 before as when unspecified this is the nginx default. Because of this we got HTTP 308's when getting our content from nginx-ingress from a HA proxy configuration which fetches the content in HTTP/1.0 from multiple sources of which nginx-ingress is only one. Changing this in HA proxy is currently not an option.
We could ofcourse override the whole template using a configmap but this is undesirable as it's easy to forget to update this configmap whenever there's a newer nginx-ingress with an updated template...

Currently Lua code sends metrics to the controller for every request right after Nginx finishes responding. This means the load on controller increases linearly with the number of requests. That results in high CPU usage and dropped metrics (""`Resource unavailable` - when the controller can not process the metrics)"".
This PR changes the logic in Lua side to batch the metrics and send the batches periodically to the controller. I've configured the period to 1s for now. Since we are batching the metrics in Nginx worker's memory to avoid potential unbounded memory increase I've also added limit on the number of metrics that can be batched during that `1s`. That number is `10000` right now - which is a really high number. With this change Nginx would be dropping metrics only if an Nginx worker is handling more than `10000 RPS`.

I've tested this change locally under heavy load and did not see any example of metric being dropped or ""Resource unavailable"" error. Note however this change means metrics will be delayed for a second.

When `enable-dynamic-certificates` is on, SSL Certificates won't be written on disk, and will be served dynamically from the shared Lua dictionary using OpenResty's SSL library (https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/ssl.md), which will avoid reloading NGINX. This PR also adds in E2E tests for the dynamic certificates functionality.

ingress-nginx,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls/2972,https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2972,ElvinEfendi,consistently fallback to default certificate when TLS is configured,"**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Currently having TLS configured in an Ingress Spec does not guarantee that Nginx will be configured using SSL endpoint. Whenever TLS configured we first check the following three edge cases:
1. We extract secret name, and if the secret name is empty _we then fallback using default certificate and configure Nginx with HTTPS endpoint_
2. Otherwise we continue to check local SSL store and if there is no corresponding secret we don't configure `SSLCert` for the given server. _This means the controller configures Nginx using HTTP endpoint only_
3. If secret name is present and there corresponding secret in the SSL store, we match the hostname with the one in the certificate if it does not match, we again do not configure `SSLCert` for the server. _This again means the controller configures Nginx using HTTP endpoint only_

If everything is good we then use the configured certificate and configure Nginx with HTTPS endpoint.

As you can see there's inconsistency here. One option to resolve this inconsistency would be to make the edge case 1. to behave as other two, a.k.a always fallback to configuring HTTP endpoint only even though user has TLS Spec configured in their Ingress manifest. In my understanding doing this would be breaking the protocol between user and the ingress controller - what I mean is as a user when I include TLS Spec in my Ingress manifest I expect to have my server configured with HTTPS endpoint and have HTTP requests redirected to that endpoint (unless I explicitly opt-out). And I'd also expect the controller to follow the notion of default certificate it has and when there's an issue with the configured certificate (one of the three edge cases above) fallback to using the default certificate.
Another problem with this option is that we won't be able to handle certificate updates dynamically (https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/2965). Because with this option when user fixes their certificate (i.e edge case 2: user creates the missing secret) we would have to update Nginx configuration and include `listen 443 ssl ...` directive and others. Which means there's no way we can avoid reload.

Given above, this PR suggests to change the way controller handles edge cases 2. and 3. With this PR in all the edge cases where we can not successfully configure certificate we fallback to using default certificate. This solves all the issues mentioned above.

* When ingress use external auth request custom error pages do not work

## How to reproduce
* Config custom error pages following [docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/customization/custom-errors)
* Create ingress with external with following [docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/auth/oauth-external-auth)
* Make service that is target for ingress from previous step select existed pods (emulate 503 error)
* Open ingress endpoint in browser

### Expected
* To see custom error

### Exists 
* Default nginx error

## Explain fix
Following nginx [docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page)
```
These directives are inherited from the previous level if and only if there are no error_page directives defined on the current level. 
```
In case we use `external auth` we have define `error_page` on `location` level, so it broke inherit from 
`server` level for all custom error pages.
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/rootfs/etc/nginx/template/nginx.tmpl#L1030
```
                  {{ if $location.ExternalAuth.SigninURL }}
                  error_page 401 = {{ buildAuthSignURL $location.ExternalAuth.SigninURL }};
                  {{ end }}
```

To fix that we need redefine custom error pages on the `location` level 

```
        location {{ $path }} {
            {{ $ing := (getIngressInformation $location.Ingress $location.Path) }}
            set $namespace      ""{{ $ing.Namespace }}"";
            set $ingress_name   ""{{ $ing.Rule }}"";
            set $service_name   ""{{ $ing.Service }}"";
            set $service_port   ""{{ $location.Port }}"";
            set $location_path  ""{{ $location.Path }}"";

            {{ if $all.Cfg.EnableOpentracing }}
            opentracing_propagate_context;
            {{ end }}

            {{ range $errCode := $all.Cfg.CustomHTTPErrors }}
            error_page {{ $errCode }} = @custom_{{ $errCode }};{{ end }} 
```

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

When external auth is enabled, nginx can support both HTTP and GRPC backends. Currently, though, it is impossible to set headers for GRPC backend as we use `proxy_set_header` rather than relying on the function `proxySetHeader` which will decide what directive to use (grpc/proxy_set_header) based on the protocol used by the backend.

Look, to be honest I havent tested this as I'm using YDD -- YOLO Driven Development :smile: 

If anyone is able to get me an image that includes this fix I can easily test it locally, as I have an ingress in front of a grpc backend with external auth enabled.

Allows users to supply a `use-forwarded-host-header` boolean option in the `ConfigMap` for the ingress controller which toggles whether the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is placed into the `Host` header.

Many proxies in front of nginx-ingress may terminate SSL or similar and require usage of `X-Forwarded-Proto` or pass client IPs in `X-Forwarded-For` but very few will move the `Host` header to `X-Forwarded-Host` and require us to place `X-Forwarded-Host` back into the `Host` header in nginx-ingress. We could disable all `X-Forwarded-*` headers using `use-forwarded-headers` however processing `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` can still be useful even when `X-Forwarded-Host`should not be considered for placement into the `Host` header.

Further certain L7 proxies or CDNs (such as Fastly) will produce multi-valued `X-Forwarded-Host` headers which should never be placed into the `Host` header.

This PR changes the default ELB idle timeout in the manifest to 60s. This is to allow connections to be properly closed by the ELB. By default, the NGINX `keepalive_timeout` is set to `75s` and with the existing config of `3600s` the ELB attempts to reuse closed connections.

Here is a link to the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/config-idle-timeout.html) that covers idle timeouts.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds and e2e-test for the edge case that currently breaks kube-lego. This issue causes requests to the path `/.well-known/acme/challenge` to be redirected to the `/` path when the rewrite-target annotation is set for the index route.

This annotation enforces the use of the `~*` location modifier. In NGINX, regex paths take priority over regular prefixes unless the `=` or `^~` location modifiers are used.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR fixes the edge case that currently breaks kube-lego. 

This issue causes requests to the path `/.well-known/acme/challenge` to be redirected to the `/` path when the rewrite-target annotation is set for the index route. This annotation enforces the use of the `~*` location modifier. In NGINX, regex paths take priority over regular prefixes unless the `=` or `^~` location modifiers are used. 

After this PR, when `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` is set on ANY ingress, then the `^~` location modifier will be enforced on paths that do NOT use the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation. Paths on the ingress with the annotation set will continue to use the `~*` location modifier. 

The only exception to the enforcement of the `^~` location modifier is for the `/` path. If the `^~` location modifier were to be used on the index route, then it would be turn into a catch-all and regex paths would never be checked.

### **What this PR does / why we need it**:

1. Reverts https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3078
2. Sort the locations by path length in descending order in the NGINX template
3. Enforce the ~* location modifier on ALL paths

The goal of this is to allow for longest path matching without having to prioritize either regex or non-regex paths. In addition, this would allow a user to use regex on non-rewrite annotated paths.

### **How this works**: 
NGINX regex matching uses **first match** not **longest match**. Ordering by descending length will help resolve this problem.

### **Which issue this PR fixes** *: 
fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1415

### **Special notes for your reviewer**:
Due to the nature of how NGINX does regex matching, there will still be edge cases. However they are far less blocking than what currently exists:

#### Example edge case: long regex
Let two paths be defined on an ingress:
- `/foo/bar`
- `/foo/[A-Z0-9]{32}`

A request to `foo/bar` will hit `/foo/[A-Z0-9]{32}`

~At this time the PR is mainly to foster discussion around the necessity of `default-backend-service`.~
The idea is not everyone requires custom default backend and it should not be ingress-nginx's concern to provide a sophisticated default backend. What I'm suggesting in this PR is to make `default-backend-service` optional. When it is not given then ingress-nginx returns 404 directly from Nginx. When configured then the existing behaviour is held.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: This PR corrects the file permission when creating "".passwd"" files for basic authentication

When using the unprivileged ``www-data`` user, ingress-controller creates the files inside ``/etc/ingress-controller/auth`` with permission 0660. As the ingress-controller runs as root, this leads to creating files without permission to NGINX process, and giving log errors as:

```
*15 open() ""/etc/ingress-controller/auth/namespace-ingress.passwd"" failed (13: Permission denied), client: 10.10.10.10, server: test.lab, request: ""GET / HTTP/2.0"", host: ""test.lab""

Escape '\n' simbols when logging 'Location denied' error in nginx configuration. Without it, nginx completelly breaks and it's unable to generate new configurations affecting other possible tenants in the cluster.

**Which issue this PR fixes**
We create an ingress object with an incorrect ip-whitelisting annotation. For example:
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cafe-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: |
       # This comment breaks ingress
       8.8.8.8/32,
       9.9.9.9/32
spec:
  rules:
  - host: cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /tea
        backend:
          serviceName: tea-svc
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /coffee
        backend:
          serviceName: coffee-svc
          servicePort: 80
```
Ingress will start failing with an error:
```

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR does the following: 
1. Reverts https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3078
2. Adds `use-regex` annotation:
    -  Allows a user to use regex on non-rewritten paths
    - For a given host, if any location uses the `rewrite-target` __or__ `use-regex` annotation, then the `~*` location modifier on ALL locations within that hosts `server` block
3. Documents how to use this annotation and how regular expression prioritization works in NGINX

The goal of this is to allow for longest path matching without having to prioritize either regex or non-regex paths. In addition, this would allow a user to use regex on non-rewrite annotated paths.


**Which issue this PR fixes**: fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/1360

**Previous attempts to solve this problem:**
- Always enforcing regex location modifer: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3123
- Custom location modifier through annotation: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1415

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
I was trying to activate the dynamic geoip2 module added in 0.16 as follows:
```
main-snippet: |
    load_module /etc/nginx/modules/ngx_http_geoip2_module.so;
```

but then getting the error:
```
Error: exit status 1
nginx-ingress-controller 2018/10/02 13:24:16 [emerg] 21791#21791: ""load_module"" directive is specified too late in /tmp/nginx-cfg246481140:21

nginx-ingress-controller nginx: configuration file /tmp/nginx-cfg246481140 test failed
```

And turns out the `load_module` commands need to be listed before the `event` block.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

When the `rewrite-target` annotation is used and the written path uses regex and does not end in `/` (ex. `foo/bar/.+`), rewrite does not work as expected. This provides a regex check in `BuildProxyPass` and uses a custom rewrite block if the `use-regex` annotation is true for a location.

_UPDATE_
In addition to the above, this PR deprecates the `AddBaseUrl` annotation. 

**Problem**

An ingress is created with `use-regex=""true""` and `rewrite-target=""/new""` and the path `/foo/bar/.+`.

This results in the following rewrite blocks for that location:
```
rewrite (?i)/foo/bar/.+/(.*) /new/$1 break;
rewrite (?i)/foo/bar/.+$ /new break;
...
```

Therefore a request to `/foo/bar/bar` will go to `/new` instead of `/new/bar` as a user may expect.

**Solution**

Check if a use-regex is true for a location when building the proxy pass. 

An ingress is created with `use-regex=""true""` and `rewrite-target=""/new/$1""` and the path `/foo/bar/(.+)`.

This results in the following rewrite blocks for that location:
```
rewrite (?i)/foo/bar/(.+) /new/$1 break;
...
```

Now a request to `/foo/bar/bar` will go to `/new/bar`.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This is one option of making the template work when the literal `$` character is in a path. We ran into this testing the new regex functionality where we have paths using regexes that contain a `$`.

I had a hard time finding another way to get a literal `$` in a set variable in nginx. This idea was found in this thread - https://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,218536,218559 .

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

Using the geo module definitely feels really strange. When we were using a custom template to facilitate regex, before testing the `use-regex` functionality that will come in 0.20.0, we just removed the `set $location_path` declaration as it didn't appear to be used by the template anywhere else that we could see and we didn't need to use it anywhere custom. We also considered a string replace with something like `%24` rather than this type of hack. There is possibly a better way to facilitate getting a `$` character in a set that I can't find.",['ElvinEfendi'],2,2018-10-05 23:10:44,2018-10-09 22:52:40,2018-10-09 22:52:40,True,2018-10-09 22:52:39,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

This change makes it clear to those reading the documentation that this is a potential gotcha. Also, while I was at it, I improved some of the language in the example to be slightly clearer.

**Which issue this PR fixes**: N/a, documentation improvement only.

authbind uses a setuid binary to bind a privileged port, so we need

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

I'm wondering why no one noticed this before - I guess there are few
clusters configured with a pod security policy disabling privilege
escalation by default.

I'm also wondering whether `setcap` in the Dockerfile is still necessary
given that ingress-nginx now uses authbind, which acquires the
capability by running with uid 0 instead of having the capability
assigned explicitly (as far as I understand).

After loading the initial configuration it will start listening for dynamic configuration. To avoid sending the initial list of backends before nginx is actually listening, there is currently a static 1 second sleep during the initial setup.

For larger or more complex configurations, the delay for nginx to begin listening for backend configurations can exceed 1 second. In that case, there is no retry which means the configuration is never loaded which means nginx health checks fail forever sending it into a crash loop.

This PR adds a retry backoff during the initial configuration to handle these larger delays. For most deployments, this should have identical behavior of sleeping 1s and then working. For the longer ones, if the initial call to `/configuration/backends` fails, the subsequent retries should eventually apply the backend configuration.","['aledbf', 'ElvinEfendi']",2,2018-10-12 04:05:41,2018-10-12 17:01:22,2018-10-12 18:45:33,True,2018-10-12 17:01:21,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

Test image: `quay.io/aledbf/nginx-ingress-controller:0.415`

To test this we need to simulate network issues:

1. In a terminal run `kubectl proxy --address=0.0.0.0 --accept-hosts=.*`
2. In a different terminal:
```
export HOST_IP=<IP eth0 or ne0>

docker run --net=host -it \
    -e POD_NAMESPACE=ingress-nginx \
    -e POD_NAME=local \
    quay.io/aledbf/nginx-ingress-controller:0.415 \
    /nginx-ingress-controller \
    --configmap=ingress-nginx/nginx-configuration \
    --apiserver-host=http://$HOST_IP:8001 \
    --publish-status-address=1.1.1.1
```
3. wait a minute and terminate `kubectl proxy`
4. wait a minute and start `kubectl proxy` again

the election of a new leader should appear in the log after the reconnection

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Currently ingress controller try to update status for each ingress
resource in a parallel by using Goroutine, and inside this Goroutine we
are trying to sort same IngressStatus reference which is shared between
all Goroutine, this will break the original refrence if some Goroutine
tried to sort exact same time.
So we should have done sorting before passing reference to each
Goroutine to prevent from breaking original reference

Currently, the _geoip2_ databases baked into the docker image do not work. This can be verified in the following way:

1. Install _libmaxminddb_ (e.g. on macOS `brew install libmaxminddb`)
2. `docker run -it quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.20.0 sh`
3. `docker cp <CONTAINER_ID>:/etc/nginx/geoip/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb .`
4. `mmdblookup --file GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb --ip 1.1.1.1`

ingress-nginx,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pulls/3341,https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3341,clandry94,Add canary annotation and alternative backends for traffic shaping,"**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Adds support for multi-service routing per ingress by means of alternative backends. It also implements an interface to create these alternative backends through the form of canary annotations. 

### Some terms
**AlternativeBackend** - An alternative backend is a normal ingress-nginx backend with the condition that it is not backed through the typical 1:1 backend-server relationship. Instead, alternative backends share a server with another real backend.

**Primary Backend** - This is the same as a backend. I prefix with the word primary to have a clearer distinction between it and a alternative backend. 

### How it works

#### Canary
As described in the linked issue above, the following annotation
```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: true
```
Combined with a combination of the below annotations, we can define the behaviour of the canary. 

The canary will define a `canary-weight`. If only weight is specified, then n% of traffic will be shifted to the canary backend. Additionally, if `canary-by-cookie` or `canary-by-header` are set, they will shift all traffic which match the cookie/header set with a value of `always` to the canary backend. If no value is set for the header, it will follow the rules of `canary-weight`. 

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-cookie: <cookie name>
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header: <header name>
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: <0 to 100>
```

After the spec is applied, the ingress in question has it's backends marked as alternative so that the merging code will know what to do with them.

#### AlternativeBackends

When ingresses are synced, the list of backends and servers is built up. After these lists are finished being built in `getBackendServers()`, but before they are sorted and returned to the sync function, we check if the current ingress has a canary enabled. If so, we pass a reference of the ingress, annotations, upstreams, and servers to the `mergeVirtualBackends` function. It works as such:
1) For each path that matches a alternative backend, find the server that matches its path and is not alternative. 
2) If found, embed a alternative backend into the primary backend. If no matching path is found, then delete the alternative upstream as it is invalid and has no server to back it. 

When alternative backends are matched to a primary backend, they will have access to metadata that describes the primary backend as well as rules to shape traffic. These rules come from the canary ingress configuration.

With `optional_no_ca`, a CA certificate is useless.

Current `nginx.tmpl` outputs `ssl_verify_client` only if `CertificateAuth.CAFileName` is provided. This assumption undermines the ability to use `optional_no_ca` without also specifying a CA certificate. [Per definition](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html), `optional_no_ca` should allow an empty CA in a valid nginx.conf.

This PR changes the template to output `ssl_verify_client` when `CertificateAuth.VerifyClient` is present and does not equal `off`. A few other portions of the template which made the same assumption are also adjusted to follow suit (related `proxy_set_header` directives).

With `optional_no_ca`, a CA certificate is useless.

Current `nginx.tmpl` outputs `ssl_verify_client` only if `CertificateAuth.CAFileName` is provided. This assumption undermines the ability to use `optional_no_ca` without also specifying a CA certificate. [Per definition](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html), `optional_no_ca` should allow an empty CA in a valid nginx.conf.

This PR changes the template to output `ssl_verify_client` when `CertificateAuth.VerifyClient` is present and does not equal `off`. A few other portions of the template which made the same assumption are also adjusted to follow suit (related `proxy_set_header` directives).

**don't merge yet, I plan on adding a test for this case**

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
If a canary backend is created at the catch all level of the ingress spec, it can merge with itself in some situations. If this happens, then the real backend won't know it exists. 

This fixes the problem by iterating over each location at `defServerName` and merges with the first backend which has a server rather than the backend at location 0.

Fix memory leaks in high concurrent requests. 


In the case of higher QPS, the ingress-nginx-controller has serious memory leaks. After troubleshooting, the reason is that the stream_latency in `socket.go` uses the prometheus summary data type, the summary data type uses the global lock [#L277](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/vendor/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/summary.go#L277). the request volume is large, The global lock will cause a lot of gorontinue to wait, the memory cannot be released, and each gorontinue The variable allocation memory is large (variables contain up to 1w request information).

After upstream_latency is changed to use the prometheus Histogram data type, the CPU is reduced and there is no memory leak, because the Histogram logic is simple and no locks are used.

This was added in changeset 51cf184c51, but overlooked in the documentation.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Simple documentation update. I found it because Fluent Bit was failing to parse nginx-ingress logs -- [I found an nginx-ingress regex](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/1664) which matched the docs here and the default value of [`log-format-upstream`](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#log-format-upstream), but did not match against the actual logs.

This is the regex from the issue comments linked above:
```
(?<remote_addr>[^ ]*) - \[(?<proxy_protocol_addr>[^ ]*)\] - (?<remote_user>[^ ]*) \[(?<time>[^\]]*)\] ""(?<method>\S+)(?: +(?<request>[^\""]*) +\S*)?""

Assuming the cluster uses an external authorization service, 
currently activation of external authorization is per ingress rule, that means the annotation `auth-url` needs to be added to every service that is publicly available. We call this security by opt-in.
To improve this concept to security-by-default be propose to add a parameter to the configmap which takes care of authorizing every request automatically. 

The existing `no-auth-locations` is used to manually whitelist services, the new code creates the needed internal `location` and adds a sub-auth request to every regular location, just as happens with the `auth-url` annotation

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Ingress affinity session cookies did not set the `Secure` flag when the Ingress is called through HTTPS. The affinity cookie is therefore ignored by the client and every recurring request to the ingress will result in a new `Set-Cookie` header being send, preventing stickyness to work.
Since ingresses may be called both through both HTTP and HTTPS, setting the `Secure` flag depends on the context.

My proposal to solve it:

- nginx has a variable $https set to ""on"" in SSL mode 
(See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#var_https).
- lua_resty_cookie has a boolean attribute `secure` 
(See https://github.com/cloudflare/lua-resty-cookie/blob/master/lib/resty/cookie.lua#L156)
- ingress-nginx has a `cookie_data` map that has no set a `secure` attribute yet. Adding the key `secure = ngx.var.https == ""on""` should be sufficiant to set the `Secure` when (and only when) being in SSL mode. 
(See https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/rootfs/etc/nginx/lua/balancer/sticky.lua#L56)

This PR fixes a problem with the canary ingress feature where canary ingresses depend on the order of which they were applied. It also adds a check that a canary ingress cannot be merged into the default upstream when no other ingresses have been applied.

To make canary ingresses order independent, the `getBackendServers` function first sets aside canary ingresses as it iterates across them. Then, after servers are created for every real ingress, the a check is done to make sure merging is safe and canary ingresses are iterated over and merged. The current condition for knowing if it is safe to merge canary ingresses is whether the `length of ingresses - length of canary ingresses >  0` If true, we know that a real ingress must exist and there is a potential match which can be merged into. This is currently more of a sanity check than a condition for ""safeness"", but this function can be used to add more conditions for safeness if necessary.

The bug stayed unnoticed for quite some time since it only breaks for slow requests if the timing is right. Related issue: #3533

I'm aware the test is potentially racy, since I don't ensure the HTTP request was made before starting pod shutdown and likewise don't keep the request going until the pod is in terminating phase. Running the e2e test locally and on Travis makes it spot the bug, though, if I revert #3536 ([working](https://travis-ci.org/breunigs/ingress-nginx/jobs/466439728) vs [broken](https://travis-ci.org/breunigs/ingress-nginx/jobs/466452430)).",['aledbf'],1,2018-12-11 12:08:23,2018-12-21 14:33:28,2018-12-21 14:33:28,True,2018-12-21 14:33:28,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3474 among other things also changed how we store ingresses - since that PR we clone an Ingress object's attributes selectively and make use of that clone afterwards in the controller. While cloning we missed `ing.Status` field and status updates relies on this field at https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/ee3a8fe581fd523aa5bd8b67a6a2f7a761b01a30/internal/ingress/status/status.go#L360 to make a decision whether it should update the status of given ingress. Since we don't copy this field, status updater will always see it as empty and will always try to update redundantly.

This PR fixes the issue by making sure the `Status` field is copied when we clone Ingress objet.

Previously we have switched to explicitly seeding PRNG for tests and this PR does it for production code. I've also patched `math.randomseed` so that individual modules can not re-seed PRNG since that can potentially affect randomness. And the reason why I'm seeding per worker rather than in `init_by_lua` is because otherwise every worker would be seeded with the same seed.

`lua_ingress.lua` will be used for general things such as this. And eventually I'd like it to be the only entry point to Lua code that executes everything else.

`backend.service.spec[""type""]` equals `""ExternalName""`.  If so,
the script does a DNS lookup on the name in order to configure
the backend configuration.

However, before this commit, the k8s `Service` data was
_not_ set on the `Backend` struct passed into the `tcp_udp_balancer.lua`
script and therefore the `ExternalName` check always returned false.

This commit fixes the issue by setting the `Service` field on
the `Backend` struct. This also requires adding a new field to the
`L4Backend` struct, so that it's available to set on the `Backend`.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR introduce more flexibility into the existing definition of the canary routing rules. The current implementation requires sending a header with a fixed value in order to trigger a canary routing which requires dedicated changes in the code of the application. This is less convenient when the application already has a header which can be used given its value represents a partition of users applicable to the canary testing (e.g. tenant id in the multi-tenant application).

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

It provides two tests (minimal example) to illustrate a problem when encountering a service with no endpoints. One expects a generated 503 response in this case by the ingress-nginx.
But if such a change happened during runtime (e.g. replica-count changed from 2 to 0)
a 502 or 504 is returned instead.

This issue seems to have been outlined by the following github issues:
* #3070 
* #3335 

I also added an attempt at fixing the issues (by removing the backend from the lua cache when there are no endpoints, instead of skipping it).

When there are multiple locations per server, where each location is configured to point to the same server/backend, ingress-nginx will merge alternative backend into the main one repeatedly.

Ex:
```
  {
    ""name"": ""web-app-80"",
    ""service"": {
      ""metadata"": {
        ""creationTimestamp"": null
      },

...

    ""noServer"": false,
    ""trafficShapingPolicy"": {
      ""weight"": 0,
      ""header"": """",
      ""cookie"": """"
    },
    ""alternativeBackends"": [
      ""web-canary-app-80"",
      ""web-canary-app-80"",
      ""web-canary-app-80""
    ]
  },
```

Here, `web-canary-app-80` gets merged 3 times while having 3 ingresses with different locations. All pointing to the same server `web-app`.

This causes no real issue for now but is definitely incorrect.

When calculated automatically we set `worker_rlimit_nofile` and `worker_connections` to the same value. This can be problematic because connections are not the only things using file descriptors. Nginx can be using file descriptors to open temporary files it uses to store cached data, or for serving static asset, or serving compressed data from disk etc.

This PR suggest to set the `worker_connections` to 75% of `worker_rlimit_nofile`, but I'm not yet convinced this is the best option. Open for discussion.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds a command-line tool to the image, `/dbg`, that can inspect various parts of the nginx configuration, including the dynamic parts used by lua. This should make it easier to debug problems to do with the generated configuration.

Right now, it can query the `/configuration/backends` and `/configuration/general` endpoints and display the result. In the case of the backend endpoint, it can also filter the output by backend name. It also includes a subcommand that essentially performs `cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` just to save on typing.

In the future, I'd also like to add the ability to inspect the dynamically loaded SSL keys that are also managed by lua, as well as anything else that makes debugging easier.

Right now, support for ingresses like the following is broken:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: ""8k""
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: echo-service
    servicePort: 8080
  rules:
  - host: example.com
```
While it will route requests for example.com to the service, none of the annotations are applied. This is in contrast to the behaviour of

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress2
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: ""8k""
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /
          backend:
            serviceName: echo-service
            servicePort: 8080
```

where the annotations are applied. If we are going to support ingress definitions like the first one here, we should support annotations for them as well.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

This PR reverses https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1233. I don't have any context as to why that change was made, so if the reasons why are still relevant it would be good to discuss.

The `--disable-catch-all` flag that was recently added in https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3586 is supposed to disallow ingresses that create a catch all server. Normally, a catch all server is created only if an ingress both defines a default backend **and** has no rules, however the flag disallows any ingress that just defines a default backend. The result is that ingresses like this are blocked by the flag:

```yaml
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: echo-service
    servicePort: 8080
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /testpath
          backend:
            serviceName: other-service
            servicePort: 5678
```

This PR tightens the circumstances under which the flag causes an ingress to be ignored from `spec.Backend != nil` to `spec.Backend != nil && len(spec.Rules) == 0`, as well as adding a test for the new behaviour.

Currently, whenever the list of upstreams changes, the EWMA load balancer forgets all of its information, even the information of upstreams that don't change. This PR makes two changes:

1. Persist the information for upstreams that don't change when the list changes
2. Set the EWMA for new upstreams to the average, to avoid starting at 0 and consequently flooding the new upstream with requests.

Example: If the EWMAs for the current upstreams are

| Upstream  | EWMA |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 10.0.0.25:8080   | 50ms  |
| 10.0.0.26:8080 | 30ms  |

And upstream `10.0.0.27:8080` is added, the new EWMAs would be:

| Upstream  | EWMA |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 10.0.0.25:8080   | 50ms  |
| 10.0.0.26:8080 | 30ms  |
| 10.0.0.27:8080 | 40ms |

instead of setting them all to zero.

Cases covered:
- single ingress object for a hostname, both default-backend and custom-http-errors annotations set
- multiple ingress objects for the same hostname, different paths, each with their own set of default-backend and custom-http-errors annotations (eg. capturing errors to one default-backend for a certain path vs another default-backend, or the global default-backend, for a different path - via separate ingress objects but the same hostname)

This involved making the name of the error-handling location `@custom_<upstream-name>_<code>`. This is needed for the case where, within one server block, different paths (locations) are capturing the same error code but sending it to different default-backends. This means that the new 'default' error location name is `@custom_upstream-default-backend_<code>`.

While adding an e2e test for https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3615#issuecomment-451166094 I ran into DNS lookup failures when resolving DNS for external name TCP & UDP services.  Any external name TCP & UDP services defined with a hostname (vs raw IP address) do not work due to the failing DNS lookups.

This PR fixes these DNS failures.

**Details**

Before this change, `nginx.tmpl` set the `nameservers` variable on `tcp_udp_configuration.lua`. However, no code references this variable.  Instead, both `balancer.lua` and `tcp_udp_balancer.lua` load `dns.lua`, and `dns.lua` always references `configuration.nameservers`.

This PR removes the `nameservers` variable from `tcp_udp_configuration`, updates the nginx  template's `stream` config to initialize the `nameservers` variable on `configuration.lua`, and adds an e2e test to validate a L4 TCP external name service by performing a DNS lookup on google's nameservers.",['ElvinEfendi'],2,2019-02-17 22:45:55,2019-02-19 19:11:49,2019-02-19 19:29:09,True,2019-02-19 19:11:49,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

**Which issue this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close that issue when PR gets merged)*: fixes #3755

## Current features

- [x] `kubectl ingress-nginx backends`, which basically can query the output of `/dbg backends` inside ingress-nginx pods
- [x] `kubectl ingress-nginx general`, `kubectl ingress-nginx conf`, which do the same but for `/dbg general` and `/dbg conf`
- [x] `kubectl ingress-nginx ingress` which tries to output a table similar to `kubectl get ingress`, but with richer information including hostnames, paths, whether or not a rule is protected by TLS, and backend name.
- [x] `kubectl ingress-nginx info` Pretty sparse right now, just prints the internal and external addresses of the ingress-nginx deployment.

## Packaging

The plugin binaries + [krew](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew) manifest can be built using `make build-plugin`. Right now it builds for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, although I've only tested it on MacOS. Distributing the plugin would look something like this:

1. Before an `ingress-nginx` release, run `make build-plugin` and commit the generated `cmd/plugin/release` directory.
2. Add the binary tarballs to the github release (such as https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/nginx-0.22.0)
3. Make the release.
4. Make a PR in https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew-index/tree/master/plugins with the new generated `ingress-nginx.yaml` manifest

## To-do

-  [x] Right now, cloud authentication (like with GCP, AWS, etc.) is broken. It works when using the latest master versions of the various kubernetes dependencies, but not with the `1.13.3` versions we have vendored now. I'm still trying to fix this. (edit: fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/3793)
- [ ] Give the plugin the ability to actually manage `ingress-nginx` deployments as in https://gist.github.com/aledbf/db25dbc723fc7d71345a9657abfd766d. Although this may not be necessary for an MVP (edit: punting to a future PR)
- [ ] Documentation (edit: punting to a future PR)
- [ ] Handle `ingress-nginx` deployments that have names other than `ingress-nginx` (edit: punting to a future PR)
- [ ] Any other suggested improvements
- [ ] Testing (edit: punting to a future PR)

Before 0.22, setting the annotation to true would set the `x-forwarded-prefix` header value to the path value. However, now that the path always includes a capture group, doing this no longer makes sense.

This PR changes the type of the `x-forwarded-prefix` annotation from bool to string, and changes things so that the value of the `x-forwarded-prefix` header is just equal to the value of the annotation (if the annotation value exists and is non-empty).

This is actually the behaviour that is explained by the docs ([see here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#x-forwarded-prefix-header)). My guess is that when this was changed to copying the path value into the header, the docs were never updated.

This would be a breaking change, so we should probably think about how migrating would work, as well as if there is a better way to do this.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
* Add a feature to reject the admission of ingresses that generates invalid configuration

Running nginx ingress controller in production for a while, we are pretty happy about it, but we occasionally have an issue where an ingress with a corrupted configuration is injected, and prevents from any other future update of the ingress nginx configuration.
Subsequently, we need to find out the ingress causing problems and fix it.
This PR increases the feedback loop by allowing, optionally, to reject the ingress, before it gets inserted and hence preserves the sanity of the configuration.

Once the patch is applied, and the controller configured, this is the user experience in case of an invalid ingress:

This is more of an experiment at the moment! The PR implements basics of enabling and running trusted custom Lua code in different Nginx phases.

**What's a plugin?**
A plugin is set of Lua modules placed in `/etc/nginx/lua/plugins/<plugin name>/`. Every plugin has to have `main.lua` in the root. Every plugin has to bundle all of its dependencies. For now you can manually mount your plugins into that folder.

**How to configure a plugin?**
In `main.lua` implement `rewrite`, `access`, `header` or `log` functions to run your code in the corresponding Nginx phases. For an example check `hello_world` plugin included with this PR.

**How to enable and set the order of my plugins?**
In order to enable plugins you have to use a custom template. In your custom template change the argument of `plugins.init({})` with the plugin names you would like to enable. The order will be respected when running the plugins. That's all.

**Can I enable a plugin for a specific app?**
Currently no, your plugin will be executed for every app. What you can do is, condition your logic on `ngx.var.proxy_upstream_name` that uniquely identifies your app and apply it to a specific app only.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: This PR reviews nginx template in order to avoid the overwriting of `Host` header with the values inherited from `X-Forwarded-Host`. The related variable assignment map has been deleted together with the related `best_http_host` assigment within the `UseForwardedHeaders` conditional. Now `best_http_host` gets populated only once with the right value independently from the usage of `X-forwarded-*` headers through related cfm key.

This change caused the nginx.conf `satisfy` directive to always be set, even if the annotation is not set. This presents a problem as it breaks any ingress definition that sets `satisfy` using a `server-snippet` or `configuration-snippet`, because then there are two `satisfy` directives at once. This PR prevents the `satisfy` directive from being applied unless the annotation is actually present and valid.

This should not change the behaviour of ingress-nginx as leaving out the `satisfy` directive is the same as setting `satisfy all;`, which is the previous default value.

There was a goroutine started to log things upon a test that could be

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Right now we use authind to allow binding to privileged ports running as a user. This works for nginx but no for the ingress controller when ssl-passthrough is enabled or for the stream section.
Using setcap (already being used) to enable CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE we solved this problem
The downside of this is some Storage Drivers in docker, like AUFS do not support extended attributes (xattr) https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/5650 (if you intend to run the binary as a user)

Right now docker enabled overlay2 as default storage driver even in CentOS and we cannot keep trying to work everywhere. Because of that, if the docker storage driver doesn't support setcap the ingress controller needs to run as root.

- [x] Add `--service` and `--deployment` flags where appropriate for situations in which the ingress-nginx service or deployment names are not the defaults.
- [x] Add `logs` command to display the logs of an ingress-nginx controller
- [x] Add `exec` command to execute a command inside the controller
- [x] Add `ssh` command to get a shell inside the controller.
- [x] Add the `ENDPOINTS` column to `ingresses` to show the number of endpoints for the backend service (or `N/A` if it's an ExternalName). This count currently ignores some of the subtleties of endpoints where not every endpoint in a service is actually serving the particular port the ingress is using, but it's good enough for a rough count.

To get this merged, I feel like there are a few things left to consider:
- [x] Properly implementing `exec` and `ssh` (and `logs` too, with all of the flags it should support) might require duplicating uncomfortably large parts of `kubectl` functionality. It might be better to have those commands ""fall-through"" and just call kubectl directly behind the scenes with the correct pod name. I don't think this plugin will ever be used in a context where `kubectl` doesn't exist, but this warrants some discussion. **edit** exec, ssh, and logs have been replaced with kubectl fall-through
- [x] Add all of the supported `kubectl logs` flags to `logs` 
- [x] Refactoring. `main.go` in particular is getting uncomfortably large and should probably be broken up into multiple files

Some things that should probably get done before the `0.24.0` release, but maybe not necessarily in this PR:
- [ ] Adding e2e (and possibly unit) tests
- [ ] Writing documentation

**Brief**
I would like to extend ingress-nginx to be able to support different publish services on a per ingress basis for one ingress controller pod. 
![screenshot from 2019-03-07 15-38-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4409163/53964203-25613600-40ef-11e9-895e-653b0d662a63.png)

**Scenario:**
I am running several pods in my kubernetes installation that require me have a mixed scenario of ingresses for http(s) and tcp/udp ports I want to forward. 

**Example in the picture:**
I have a pod with a webservice container and a samba container where the samba container shares the configuration files for the webservice so they can be edited via filesharing mount.
I want the fileshare and webservice to be accessible under the same FQDN. And this should work for multiple different webservices but all with e.g. a samba share container.
I cant expose the samba ports for different webservices on the same loadbalancer service as they all have the same name and there is no hostname based routing for tcp/udp as for http.

**Problem:**
The scenario in the picture above technically already works with ingress-nginx. There is however one caveat, all the ingresses in kubernetes get the same IP assigned as status, which is the IP of the single publish service that is passed via the `--publish-service` arg.
When using external-dns this creates a problem as in the example in the picture above both urls (myservice1.example.com and myservice2.example.com) would resolve to the same IP. Which is no problem for HTTP proxying as this happens via hostname, but the tcp/udp proxy are going to the wrong destination.

**Proposal:**
Add an annotation to the ingress (e.g. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/publish-service: default/podsvc2`) that will tell ingress-nginx on a per ingress base to which service the ingress belongs, so it can update this ingress with the correct IP. So this would overwrite the default publish service IP on a per ingress basis.

I have been running this now for a bit over a day in my kubernetes cluster - everything seems to be working fine for now.

The PR first cleans up ssl package by

1. splitting `AddOrUpdateCertAndKey` into three functions where first we create `SSLCert` object after validating cert and key (`CreateSSLCert`) and second function where we store `SSLCert` on disk (`StoreSSLCertOnDisk `), and third function where we append CA certificate and update `SSLCert` object's relevant fields (`ConfigureCACertWithCertAndKey`). This let's us get rid of `CreateSSLCert`'s old implementation that was only for Dynamic SSL mode.

2. similarly split `AddCertAuth` into `CreateCACert` and `ConfigureCACert`. This was not necessary but is good to keep things consistent and be able to further DRY the ssl package by potentially merging `CreateCACert` with `CreateSSLCert` and by merging `ConfigureCACert` with `ConfigureCACertWithCertAndKey`.

With these refactoring it becomes more obvious that when secret includes tls, cert as well as ca.crt we don't store the bundled certificate in dynamic SSL mode. We should make sure it's stored on disk in dynamic SSL mode so that TLS client authentication works as expected in this mode.

There is still one condition where ingress-nginx needs to get the node info (to get the external IP address): when neither `--publish-service` nor `--publish-status-address` are set. It doesn't look like the same information can't be retrieved from the pod object, so it looks like this use needs to be kept around. Would it be better to just document the fact that without either of these two flags, we must make cluster level API calls, or would it be better to keep the `--force-namespace-isolation` flag and make creating an ingress-nginx instance with `--force-namespace-isolation` but neither `--publish-service` nor `--publish-status-address` an error?

Right now, it can run lints on ingresses and deployments. Linting for configmaps can be added as well.

The idea is that whenever a breaking change is made, or if we want to be able to warn about something else, you just add something to `cmd/plugin/lints/[deployment|ingress].go`. Then when we release a new version, people can run `krew update`, get the new plugin version, and then run `kubectl ingress-nginx lint --all-namespaces --verbose` and get something like the following:

```console
$ kubectl ingress-nginx lint --all-namespaces --verbose
Checking ingresses...
✗ anamespace/this-nginx
  - Contains the removed session-cookie-hash annotation.
       Lint added for version 0.24.0
       https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/3743
✗ othernamespace/ingress-definition-blah
  - The rewrite-target annotation value does not reference a capture group
      Lint added for version 0.22.0
      https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/3174

Checking deployments...
✗ namespace2/nginx-ingress-controller
  - Uses removed config flag --sort-backends
      Lint added for version 0.22.0
      https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/3655
  - Uses removed config flag --enable-dynamic-certificates
      Lint added for version 0.24.0
      https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/3808
```

If you want to check only the lints added for the new version (say 0.24.0), you could use `kubectl ingress-nginx lint --all-namespaces --verbose --from-version 0.24.0 --to-version 0.24.0` or the shorthand `kubectl ingress-nginx lint --all-namespaces -v -f 0.24.0 -t 0.24.0`

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

With gRPC backends, Authorization header was not rewritten according to `auth-response-headers`. This patch resolves this, correctly using `grpc_set_header` for the Authorization header when a gRPC backend is specified.

**Which issue this PR fixes**:

fixes #3914


Here is an example snippet from nginx.conf **before** this patch:
```
            proxy_set_header 'Authorization' $authHeader0;
            
            client_max_body_size                    1m;
            
            grpc_set_header Host                   $best_http_host;
            
            # Pass the extracted client certificate to the backend
            
            # Allow websocket connections
            grpc_set_header                        Upgrade           $http_upgrade;
            
            grpc_set_header                        Connection        $connection_upgrade;
```

And **after** this patch:
```
            grpc_set_header 'Authorization' $authHeader0;
            
            client_max_body_size                    1m;
            
            grpc_set_header Host                   $best_http_host;
            
            # Pass the extracted client certificate to the backend
