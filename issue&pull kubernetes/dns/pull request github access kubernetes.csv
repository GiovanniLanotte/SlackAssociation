It seems that during startup the kube-dns service is reporting (static) version of kubernetes:

...

which is defined in vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/version/base.go and seems rather wrong/useless. We should report kube-dns version instead, which is compiled-in during compile time.

After applying this fix:
$ make bin/amd64/kube-dns

dns,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dns/pulls/151,https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/pull/151,leblancd,Add support for SRV probes to be IPv4/IPv6 agnostic,"This change adds support for kube-dns sidecar probes that use
DNS type SRV queries.  This will allow kube-dns sidecar probes
to be configured using SRV queries such that the
configuration/manifest will be agnostic of whether kube-proxy
is operating in IPv4 vs IPv6 mode (i.e. whether kube-dns
is resolving kubernetes services to IPv4 vs IPv6 addresses).

This change will help resolve a kubeadm issue/PR that has been
filed:
    kubernetes/kubernetes#51371
    kubernetes/kubernetes#51378
although the approach in the above issue/PR will need to be
changed to use SRV rather than ANY type sidecar probes, since
the SkyDNS software that kube-dns uses does not support queries
of type ANY, and the maintainer believes that using SRV type
queries is a better approach. See:
    skynetservices/skydns#323

Changes included in this PR:
- Add support for sidecar probes of type SRV.
- Add a unit test for the probeOptions Set() method.
- Minor tweak to regexp used to check configured probe labels
  so that it looks at the entire configured label.
- Fixed an index out of bounds bug for ""invalid type for DNS""
  error messages.
