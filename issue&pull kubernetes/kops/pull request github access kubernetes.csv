so normal pods will not run on it.  But Daemonsets will, and it is
surprising that they don't work unless hostNetwork=true.

The default is now what seems to be expected:
- we allocate the master a real CIDR on the pod network
- kube-proxy runs on the master, so it can talk to pods
- we run kubelet on the master with enable-debugging-handlers, so
  kubectl logs etc works

`isolateMasters: true`

Procedure for adding encryption using default AWS key:
1. `kops create cluster --state=<state> --name=<name> --zones=<zones>`
2. `kops edit cluster --state=<state> --name=<name>`
3.  Add `encryptedVolume: true` to each etcd volume
4. Save config
5. `kops update cluster --state=<state> --name=<name> --yes`

You will now have a Kubernetes cluster with encrypted Etcd volumes.

If you want to use a custom KMS encryption key, the procedure is almost identical, but with the small wrinkle that you have to allow the `masters.your.domain` role permission to use the KMS encryption key:
1. `kops create cluster --state=<state> --name=<name> --zones=<zones>`
2. `kops edit cluster --state=<state> --name=<name>`
3.  Add `encryptedVolume: true` and `kmsKeyId: <full-arn-of-your-KMS-key>` to each etcd volume
4. Save config
5. `kops update cluster --state=<state> --name=<name> --yes`
6. Edit your KMS key to add the `masters.your.domain` role to the Key Users list - this has to be done before the master(s) attempt to to mount the volumes.  You should have at least a several minute window between the `masters.your.domain` role being created and the master(s) mounting the volume, but if you somehow miss this window, you can just delete the master(s) and the ASG will kick in and once new masters start up they should be able to mount successfully.

You will now have a Kubernetes cluster with encrypted Etcd volumes using your custom KMS key.

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/636,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/636,austinmoore-,Handle exit code 100 from 'yum check-update',"Fixes #635

One thing to note with this PR is that it imports `syscall`. In the docs it says:

> The primary use of syscall is inside other packages that provide a more portable interface to the system, such as ""os"", ""time"" and ""net"". Use those packages rather than this one if you can.

An alternative way to fix this that is not dependent on `syscall` is to do something like:

```
if state := cmd.ProcessState; err != nil && state.String() != ""exit status 100"" {
        return fmt.Errorf(""error update packages: %v: %s"", err, string(output))
}
```

Despite the message in the docs, the usage of `syscall` seems appropriate to me. The risk is low, because the usage is limited, and it seems better to compare the exit code against an int, rather than a string. If someone feels we shouldn't be using `syscall` feel free to say so.

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/819,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/819,razic,WIP: Support Weave,"## Overview 

Support for CNI was initially brought in here #621; However, the current state of networking in `kops` fails to produce a healthy cluster, when enabling CNI. This is because the current implementation does not configure/install any CNI plugin.

Here is a list of related issues:

* #537
* #709
* #764
* #773
* #777
* #778
* #787

It is my understanding the original intent of `kops`, was to decouple the task of configuring/installing CNI. Ultimately, leaving it up to the user to *get things working*.

Unfortunately, users are unable to simply `kubectl create -f https://git.io/weave-kube`, after a cluster has come up. It's the classic [""Chicken or the egg""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) dilemma — the `dns-controller` (responsible for the creation of the public endpoint to your cluster's API servers) can't be scheduled because networking is not yet set-up. You can work-around this, by `ssh`ing to your cluster to manually bring up networking.

After a little persuasion, @kris-nova and I were able to convince @chrislovecnm that baking support for popular CNI plugins directly into `kops`, was the right approach.

## Proposal

I know everyone is aching for this support, and big pull-requests suck. So I'll do my scientific best to limit the scope of changes to be the absolute minimum.

### Scope

This list will be constantly updated to reflect the desired scope for this pull-request. These are, at a minimum, what the pull should address:

* Add an option to the `--networking` flag for `kops create cluster` with at least one CNI provider; most likely, Weave.

### Usage

To spin up a cluster with CNI enabled and Weave installed:

```bash
kops create cluster --networking weave ...

For example before change, with  --network-cidr=10.0.0.0/22, the list of subnets generated by the code was:

```

```

The last CIDR 10.0.4.0/25 is beyond 10.0.0.0/22 boundaries, which causes the error:

```

With a code fix, subnets get generated in a correct way:

I was not 100% certain how to implement @justinsb comments but wanted to give this an attempt using the new `--topology private` settings.

Preference on the name? `DNS` = `public` or `private`

The feature (or similar) would certainly be useful in our configurations where `<env>.company.internal` designation is typically used.

The work is kind of rough as we are not very familiar with the internals of the project, feel free to make changes or send feedback.

Might be a non-issue once #1055 is resolved.

NOTE: [loadbalancer_attributes.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/upup/pkg/fi/cloudup/awstasks/loadbalancer_attributes.go) still needs Terraform output when using the bastion. Terraform only supports inserting attributes in the `aws_elb` definition [same situation as health checks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/1114/files#diff-00b0d5945b4937a8f4a4ef5bde97975aR193).

This pull request fixes two issues related to using a shared S3 bucket for clusters in multiple accounts:

1. An environment variable is added to control the canned ACLs that are applied to new files in the bucket. This is documented in `aws.md`.

2. The logic for retrieving the bucket location (required for talking to the correct S3 endpoint) has been modified to deal with an AWS issue (described [below](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/1247#issuecomment-274763348)). A more detailed description is added in a comment.

users), ignoring the various tags files generated all over the place
will be helpful. As I've found, a tags file needs to be generated for
certain subdirectories to avoid confusing ctags. For example, if I
run `ctags -R .` from the project root and I attempt to jump to the
definition of Execute from `cmd/kops/main.go`, I'm taken to the file
`channels/cmd/channels/root.go` instead of `cmd/kops/root.go`.
Maintaining one tags file for `cmd/kops`, however, doesn't produce the
same problem. This is why all tags files need to be ignored.

When running the `kops delete` command there are no confirmation attempts made before deleting the resource. This can lead to mishaps that could be devastating to an organization.

## The fix:

To solve this issue I created a PersistentPreRun hook on the deleteCmd which is the parent command for all resource deleting commands. This hook alerts the user that their actions cannot be undone and then asks for a confirmation. If the flag --yes is passed to the command the confirmation will be skipped.

## The test:

1. Check out the branch from my fork.
2. Run `make`
3. now run`kops delete ig mctester`. You should see output like:

```
kops delete ig mctester
Do you really want to delete ig mctester? This action cannot be undone. (Y/n)
```

Select `no` and ensure the program exits. Run it again and select `yes` and ensure the normal error for non existing resources is displayed..
4. Run the same commands agains with `--yes` and ensure no confirmation attempt is made.

Attachment/Detachment is working. Change output is fine as long as cluster spec api object is dns. If I switch it to loadbalancer the output/behaviour does not work anymore. This is caused by attachment handling of pkg/model/api_loadbalancer.go - Do anybody has a good solution to solve this?

See #729 and #1372. (Initial design discussion was in 1372).
 Users want to define custom tags for as many AWS cloud resources as possible on the CLI. This patch adds a —cloud-labels CLI option that takes a CSV list of key=value records. For example, given ""—cloud-labels Owner=Jane Doe,Team=Dev"" all resources will get an Owner and Team tag with the specified values.

**Design**
	1.	Add a ClusterLabels property to ClusterSpec (all versions of it)
	2.	Add the new option to CreateClusterOptions.
	3.	Set the labels on the ClusterSpec RunCreateCluster
	4.	Copy the ClusterLabels from ClusterSpec to cloudTags in BuildCloud

Note: I haven't used StringSliceVar as @justinsb suggested in #1372, since it complicates escaping of nested equal signs.  For example `--cloud-labels ""Foo=\""Test=true\""""` would become `--cloud-labels ""\""Foo=\""\""Test=true\""\""\"""" `. See the comment in parseCloudLabels.

This is my first attempt at making the process a lot more clearer. The biggest changes here are:

* Explain the responsibilities of each tool.
* Show usage in a progression, from creating to editing to teardown.
* Explain Terraform use from two view points i.e. creation and updating (this was not too clear in the previous version, IMHO).

I thought of explaining a little about the files that are generated (this can also be useful). Thoughts?

It adds the ability to run a script before and/or after nodeup.

The pre/post scripts are set via environment variables, exactly like `NODEUP_URL`:

    PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_URL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/pre-install-script POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_URL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/post-install-script kops update cluster

You can also set `PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_HASH` and `POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_HASH` like `NODEUP_HASH`.

It's a bit of a hack; I don't like the environment-variable-as-arguments pattern, but I don't have much experience with Go, and I needed something to get something working.

There is one caveat. The post-install step does not actually execute after nodeup has completed. It executes after nodeup has been _started_. This is because nodeup is launched in the background. I've tried to wait for it to finish, but there seems to be a weird race condition with docker and needing User Data to finish first (something like that).

In my opinion, I think if we were to continue down the pre/post install script path, a good end result would be to move these into the instance group spec. Something like `PreInstallScriptUrl` and `PostInstallScriptUrl` for each instance group. I think instance groups would be a good spot for startup stuff like this, and it's better than having it passed in via environment variables.

As discussed with @justinsb I first took a look to see if `kubectl` handled this situation. From my testing it doesn't do anything better than `kops` currently - simply prints out the edit was skipped (in general kubectl edit needs some UX improvement, see [kubernetes#26050](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/26050), so until they come up with a nice approach I think we're fine to blaze our own trail).

The approach I took here was to do the following:

1. Take the raw edited YAML and convert to map (this step normalizes the data and prevents us from false diffing)
2. Take the map and convert it back to a YAML string
3. Take the cluster object and convert it to a YAML string
4. Compare the edited YAML string to the cluster YAML string. If there are any differences, print the diff and warn the user that edits weren't applied

- When a user sets the 'taints' property on an instance group spec (via kops edit), those taints will be passed to kubelet via the new --register-with-taints flag
- See #481 #803 #1332 #1497 

**Design**
- [x] Add a Taints []string property to InstanceGroupSpec
- [x] Add a corresponding Taints property to componentconfig.go
- [x] Copy the IG property to componentconfig in BuildKubeletConfigSpec
- [x] Ensure the that the property/flag is only set when KubernetesVersion is >= 1.6
- [x] Set default taint on master to be 'dedicated=master:NoSchedule' and disable the existing tainter.go when KubernetesVersion is >= 1.6
- [x] Refactor to work with the new Taints fields in k8s 1.6

**TODO**
- [x] Add Tests
- [x] Add Docs

Example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-awesome-app
  labels:
    app: my-awesome-app
    dns: route53
  annotations:
    domainName: ""test.mydomain.tld""
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: |-
      arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:659153740712:certificate/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: ""443""
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-awesome-app
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: TCP
  type: LoadBalancer
```

An `A` record for `test.mydomain.tld` will be created as an alias to the ELB that is configured by Kuberntes (see `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer` annotations). This assumes that a hosted zone exists in Route53 for`mydomain.tld`. Any record that previously existed for that DNS record will be updated.

Required permissions already exist on the master. See:

* ELB - [pkg/model/iam/iam_builder.go#L137-L141][1]
* Route53 - [pkg/model/iam/iam_builder.go#L131-L135][2]

I'm not sure how portable it would be with @chrislovecnm's PR. Stuck on how we would mock the validate/drain logic.  We could record the # of drains the fake client did, but the validation part assumes that the cloud provider replaced any terminated nodes (right?). Alternatively we can assume validation always passes (since it has its own unit tests) and just make sure the # of drains and  terminated instances line up.

Anyways, wanted to put my progress up for the time being. If it blocks progress on the other PR I'm open to wait for it to go in and modify tests afterwards 😃

* Unclear if we want all resources to be CF managed - particularly resources that we expect to change dynamically, like ASGs.  It might be better only to manage the network in CF.
* We still perform some logic in kops (keypairs, secrets).  The intention was that we want the nodes to be more locked down, though we haven't implemented e.g. KMS which will enforce this distinction - yet.  We need to incorporate this logic into CF.
* We need to move image selection into CF; realistically this probably means selecting a particular image.  However, if we do that it isn't clear how we can update the image e.g. for security updates.

A management node is looking more and more like a safer option.  Most of the complex logic is still in CF - particularly in the networking.

100milli-cpus and 200MB RAM should be OK for most clusters, but will be too high to fit on small nodes (particularly on master).  There doesn't seem to be a clean way out of that; would you consider having a ""small node"" config as an option?

At the other end of the scale, there must be some number of nodes and pods which makes the memory usage go above 200MB.

Note this branch includes the commits from #1893 to bump the version - I did it this way to avoid creating a manual merge.

The flag has been deprecated for 2 versions and over-complicates toggling standalone mode. API server locations should be provided via the kubeconfig file instead.

This also sets `--require-kubeconfig=true` when `--kubeconfig` is used, in case https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40050 doesn't go in (since we are so close to the freeze). Due to an edge case (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/40050#issuecomment-276569990) `--require-kubeconfig=true` must be set along with `--kubeconfig` in pre-40050 clusters for things to work properly.

@kris-nova @chrislovecnm @yissachar: Let me know your thoughts on this. 

~~The only problem I'm running into is with the integration-test framework, which doesn't like non-determinism in names. For example, in TestPrivateCanal, I need to figure out how to get the generated name for the ELBs in to the expected kubernetes.tf file. I'm inclined to make the expected file a template and insert the generated name, but don't see an easy way to retrieve the generated name in the first place.~~

Edit: Feedback from @justinsb and @chrislovecnm from March 3 office hours:
- [ ] need to ensure we don't rename existing ELBs during updates
- [ ] use truncated hash instead of random strings. We want names deterministic.
- [ ] don't truncate names unless they exceed the 32 char limit.

To ensure backwards compatibility, I think we'll have to update the ELB Find() method to look for both truncated (eg api-foo) names, as well as whatever convention we settle on for this PR. When a result is found with the former, we'd also have to compare the KubernetesCluster tag, to confirm whether it is, in fact, the ELB we're looking for. Are there any uses cases that would miss?

changed after the running service.  However, we were not considering the
service manifest itself in the calculation, which was an error.

The bug only exposed itself though when we downloaded and updated
docker, e.g. when running k8s 1.5 with a 1.4 image.  We would write the
env file early (no dependencies), then we would download docker and
install it, and then we would write the service manifest.  But if docker
had been started during this interval (e.g. by protokube), then we would
see that docker had been started after the dependencies (the env file),
and not restart it.  When we consider the manifest file also, things
work as intended.

This feature flag provides the capability for `nodeup` to set an environment variable in systemd config files where `kubelet` will give high priority to specifically annotated pod.  This priority will allow critical pods such as CNI networking ds and DNS to be evicted last.

See the following issue for more details
kubernetes/kubernetes#41052

This PR also creates functionality for feature flags to be passed into `nodeup`.

_TODO_

- [ ] apply featureflag to only k8s 1.5.3 or greater (need to validate k8s version)
- [ ] testing

As noted, TF ""manages"" all resources however there is another class of entities, `data`, that represents a lookup instead of management of said resource. 

This might be a way of addressing issues where instead of ""owning"" the resource KOPS and the associated TF should instead ""lookup"" those values.  

This is raw and not functional, but I see a bunch of DNS work going on and figured I would throw it out there.

The current code base has where nodes are rolled in parallel when multiple ig's exist in the cluster.  Talking with @justinsb we agreed that it is best to pull this out.  Talked with a couple of end users and they were not using the functionality.  This specifically helps when rolling clusters with stateful applications.

**TODO**

Most of the logic for choosing which records to delete is from the [AWS implementation for route 53](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/upup/pkg/kutil/delete_cluster.go#L1737). 

In the near future, I would also like to add some tests for the delete cluster code paths as deleting the wrong DNS records would suck!

This PR offers the working dependency changes we need, and gets our work back up to speed to where it was before the huge vendor changes of 1.6

Offering this PR as an **alternative** to https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2184 so spare the nasty double merge conflict resolution that would need to happen in @justinsb's branch to accept mine.

I also opened up https://github.com/justinsb/kops/pull/5 that does just that if that is the route we want to take!

I would *love* to get this merged in ASAP as this has 0 impact on `kops` as it stands today.. but having this in master gives @justinsb and myself a clean starting point for iterating on the smaller features. 

Example:  I still need to fix the etcd annotations in the helm chart.

TLDR;

This is exactly the same as https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2184 but fixes the dependency issues and gets `main.go` compiling again for the server. I think we need to merge this soon (@justinsb would totes agree). This doesn't touch existing `kops` code at all. Please merge.

Before doing that I wanted to move it to a package that made more sense. Related issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2310. 

This PR only moves the contents of the file, you'll notice that `upup/pkg/kutil/delete_cluster.go` was not deleted since some code in `convert_kubeup_cluster.go` depends on it. I'm not sure when kubeup conversion to kops can be deprecated but seems like a possibility in the near future. Until then some of the code in `upup/pkg/kutil/delete_cluster.go` is duplicated in `pkg/resources` 😭 

There will be future PRs coming to refactor/clean up `pkg/resources`.

A good use for nodeLables is to implement [nodeSelector labels](https://kubernetes

[AWS EC2 auto scaling groups](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) replacing unhealthy or unreachable instances.

Note for AWS if `kops rolling-update cluster --instance-group nodes` returns ""No rolling-update required."" you'll need to 
manually terminate the EC2 node for the auto scaling group to propagate the new labels.

Currently the support for vSphere is behind feature flag VSphereCloudProvider.

General guideline about how to use kops over vSphere can be found at: docs/development/vsphere-dev.md

There are some temporary work-arounds in this PR:
1. Due to the gap between upstreaming and release, there are changes to enable user to define different binary/image for nodeup/protokube/dns-controller. These changes can be removed after the vSphere supported is fully included into release binaries.
2. vSphere provider by default uses CoreDNS as DNS service provider. Since one of the interface functions used by current dns-controller in kops (ResourceRecordSets.List()) is not implemented in CoreDNS provider yet, there are work-arounds added inside dns-controller related code. Those work-arounds only affect when the DNS provider is set to CoreDNS. Those work-arounds can be removed after the missing interface function is implemented in CoreDNS dns provider.

I would be happy to put in some time to help clean these commands up, but I'd like to decide what is correct before changing things back and forth a bunch of times. 

My proposal is one alternative, I'm not married to the exact implementation with respect to tense and layout and anything else, but I'd like to get an implementation that folks are OK with and write it down somewhere. Then it's relatively easy to actually do the work. 

Alongside that, I added `kops` to `gen-cli-docs` target so that you get the latest docs after you've updated your cobra code.

mapping.

PR #1872 gave the ability to users to define a custom log path for the
apiserver to write its audit logs to. Prior to this commit, the log file
would stay within the container's filesystem, and getting access to it from
outside the container was a nuisance.

This change allows a logging aggregator, like fluentd, to be able
to read and tail this log from outside the kube-apiserver container.

This PR continues the work on https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/1873 for an end user to have the capability to create specific policies that will be used by kops.  

### Capability

Custom IAM policies can be a complicated, and maintaining those policies create technical debt.  To automate the maintenance of these policies, kops can now create its own fine grain IAM policies.

The current IAM policies have been given a much shorter hair cut.  Permissions such as `ec2:*` and `s3:*` no longer exist.  Also, the nodes had Route53 permissions, which they should not have.  The node permissions are now very limited.

### TODO

- [X] create admin policy for running kops
- [x] create admin policy for running kops in a provided VPC
- [x] create master policy
- [x] create node policy
- [x] test k8s policies
- [x] documentation
- [x] testing and more testing
- [x] update unit tests

## Testing

I have tested the following different installs with 1.6.3.

1. EBS PV and PVC creation
1. ELB - used the go guestbook
1. Encrypted volumes
1. HA public kubenet
1. HA private weave
1. Single master public kubenet

I have not tested ECR, but I have not changed those permissions.  I have not tested the new IAM permissions for working with SSL certs and ELBs, as I do not have an SSL cert with AWS.

E2E is happy as well.

When the documentation mentioned ""create or update cluster spec"" for example, it was confusing what was actually updated. It's not the cluster.spec file.
As I understand, `cluster.spec` should only be created/updated after `kops update --yes` is run.

I changed the docs for `kops get`, `kops create`, `kops replace`, `kops edit`.
I did NOT change those files: `kops_rolling-update.md`, `kops_rolling-update_cluster.md` as I think those actually use `cluster.spec`.

I thought this would be a good first PR, and it makes the Makefile a little more readable (to me) while also making sure files in the Git repo don't disturb the build process (e.g. a file called `kops` in the root would previously stop `kops` from building and installing).

* Run `make help` and see the target appear in the list of targets like so:
    * <target name> - <description> (deps: <target dependencies>)
* Targets are ordered and separated in documented and undocumented targets.
* There's also an automatically generated list of variables that are taken from the environment.

It's based on the Unix utilities `grep`, `sed` and `sort`. I'm not sure if I should do something to mark them as new dependencies, they're not build dependencies so I'm not sure how important that is.

I image we're trying to limit the number of flags on `kops cluster create` but considering we allow changing the topology, changing the api server loadbalancer to public or internal seems to make things much easier for people like me who only expose ingress endpoints publicly.  

I'm not super familiar with the code so I'm open to any changes or naming ideas but hope others can find this as useful as I!

New API values

```
type Assets struct {
	ContainerRegistry *string `json:""containerRegistry,omitempty""`
	FileRepository      *string `json:""fileRepository,omitempty""`
}
```

And a top level API object used for get and create methods with inventory items.
```
type Inventory struct {
	v1.TypeMeta `json:"",inline""`
	ObjectMeta  metav1.ObjectMeta `json:""metadata,omitempty""`

	Spec InventorySpec `json:""spec,omitempty""`
}

type InventorySpec struct {
	Cluster              *ClusterSpec           `json:""cluster,omitempty""`
	ChannelAsset         *ChannelAsset          `json:""channel,omitempty""`
	KopsVersion          *string                `json:""kopsVersion,omitempty""`
	KubernetesVersion    *string                `json:""kubernetesVersion,omitempty""`
	ExecutableFileAsset  []*ExecutableFileAsset `json:""executableFileAssets,omitempty""`
	CompressedFileAssets []*CompressedFileAsset `json:""compressedFileAssets,omitempty""`
	ContainerAssets      []*ContainerAsset      `json:""containerAssets,omitempty""`
	HostAssets           []*HostAsset           `json:""hostAsset,omitempty""`
}
```

These API values allow for:

1. define custom base repository for all containers; k8s, protokube, dnscontroller
2. define custom base web location for all binaries; k8s, nodeup, etc
3. `kops inventory get` displays current inventory of cluster

Another PR will come in after this PR which provides `kops inventory create`.  Uploads all items generated by `kops get inventory`.

Design Notes:

1. Choose to add an inventory API struct value to create an interface for outputting inventory data.  Was able to use API machinery to marshall and unmarshal the structs automatically.  Customers will want to use the inventory data to track security issues from external screening systems.
2. apply_cluster.go requires an ssh key in the keystore in s3 to run.  We need to run `kops get inventory` and `kops create inventory` before a cluster exists.  I created a dummy key and then delete it in S3.  Any ideas on how to work around this would be appreciated.
3. apply_inventory.go iterates through the tasks and only selects the correct addons by version.  We could not use the regular apply_cluster.go task iterations because addons are not rendered, and k8s versions are not parsed.
4. Created a new apply_cluster target inventory, because the dry run target outputs to STDOUT.  With `kops get inventory -o yaml` this did not function correctly.


**TODO List**

- [x] Back out Makefile changes
- [x] Test ENV variables
- [x] Test a couple more assets
- [x] Test upload assets
- [x] Clean-up output on `kops get inventory -o table`
- [x] Back out `kops create inventory`
- [x] Testing testing and more testing
- [x] Some more unit tests (that or file an issue for them) https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2713
- [x] Code level documentation
- [x] File issue about validation
- [x] Put back dnscontroller rendering
- [x] ~~Document how to use assets~~ Going to put in another PR for this.  @robertojrojas is submitted the PR with the upload code, so we need this PR merged, then that PR, and then the docs.
- [X] File issues about current CVEs - since we now have that data https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2658
- [X] File issue about apply_cluster.go needing a ssh key https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2659

I should admit that I don't have a full understanding of why the calico-configure job is suddenly having issues, nor have I tested this fix :disappointed: 

But this is the new de-facto way to configure pools since Calico v2.1 (calico/node:v1.1.0), so no need to string along this configure job any more.

I'm still ramping up on how to deploy kops, so if someone is available to quickly test, it would be much more efficient.

- Editing an existing cluster and adding `mtu: 8912`, then running update cluster. The ManagedFile for weave was updated as expected, however I am not sure what the process would be to actually get the settings rolled out.
- Creating a new cluster with command line flags (it sets `mtu: 8912` as expected)
- Creating a new cluster with `kops create -f mycluster.yml` based on https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/tests/integration/privateweave/in-v1alpha2.yaml with minor edits

Todo:
- Update docs

Let me know if there's anything else I need to do.

It also outputs a diff on failure now, so it's clearer what went wrong/what commands the failure applies to.

There's one part of the script I didn't understand so I left it with a FIXME (the script unsets `KOPS_STATE_STORE`).

Another change I made is setting the `-euC` flags on the Makefile, so we can hopefully let fewer errors slip through by accident.

The last change in the diff enforces the order of execution of a few targets which need to be ordered according to the preceding comment; this was not enforced before (it would've failed when executing `make` in parallel).

The idea is to rename the `replace` command to `apply`, to closer match `kubectl` and lower mental overhead.

I implemented an alias to the `replace` command and marked the `replace` command as deprecated in the CLI help and docs. I don't expect this PR to pass without any discussion, I'm just hoping this PR will speed up and focus the discussion.

(It also includes a bit of documentation that was in `master` but had not been generated, I don't quite understand how that got through CI.)

The first option is the current code path. All masters and bastions are rolled sequentially before the nodes, and this flag does not control their replacement.

1. ""asg"" - A node is drained then deleted.  The cloud then replaces the node automatically. (default)
2. ""pre-create"" - All node instance groups are duplicated first; then all old nodes are cordoned.
3. ""create"" - As each node instance group rolls, the instance group is duplicated, then all old nodes are cordoned.

The second and third options create new instance groups; next, the old nodes are cardoned.  The old nodes are drained, and then the instance group(s) is deleted. 

The second option pre-creates a whole new set of instance groups first, while the third option only creates a new ig as each ig is rolled.

The first and default option is the original code path.

""real"" clientsets, so now it is relatively easy to add a second implementation
that will be backed by a real clientset.

The snafu here is that we weren't really using namespaces previously.
Namespaces do seem to be the primary RBAC scoping mechanism though, so we start
using them with the real clientset.

The namespace is currently inferred from the cluster name.  We map dots to
dashes, because of namespace limitations, which could yield collisions, but
we'll deal with this by simply preventing users from creating conflicting
cluster names - i.e. you simply won't be able to create a.b.example.com and
a-b.example.com

as expected.

The kube-apiserver first has to rename the existing audit log prior to a new one
being created. Renaming is not possible when the audit file is mounted
directly as the host path. kube-apiserver will return a 'Device or
resource busy' error when it tries to do so. So instead, we mount the
directory of the path instead of the file itself. Also remove the
creation of an empty audit log file as that is no longer necessary for
Docker to mount a directory.

""If an audit log file already exists, Kubernetes appends new audit logs
to that file. Otherwise, Kubernetes creates an audit log file at the
location you specified in audit-log-path. If the audit log file exceeds
the size you specify in audit-log-maxsize, Kubernetes will rename the
current log file by appending the current timestamp on the file name
(before the file extension) and create a new audit log file. Kubernetes
may delete old log files when creating a new log file; you can configure
how many files are retained and how old they can be by specifying the
audit-log-maxbackup and audit-log-maxage options.""

Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/

Tested this on Kubernetes 1.6 and with an audit log path specified to
be:
/var/log/kube-apiserver-audit.log

The kube-apiserver container has this mounted:
/dev/xvda1 on /var/log type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Tested to make sure /var/log/kube-apiserver.log's host path continues to function.

Most part of the changes are similar to current supported CNI networking provider. Kube-router also support IPVS bassed service proxy which can be used as replacement for kube-proxy. So there are two changes w.r.t kubr-proxy, where when kube-router is slected for --networking flag, kube-proxy will not be launched.

Current manifest for kube-router included with this patch enabled kube-router to provide pod-to-pod networking, IPVS based service proxy and ingress pod firewall.

I'll be doing some work to make the rolling update code more compatible with other cloud providers (related to https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/2646), wanted to move the rolling update code out of `kutil` pkg before doing so and get rid of some of the cruft left in `kutil` I forgot to remove in my previous PRs (https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2328 & https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2645).

This is not quite ready as I have the following left to do:

- Testing (Waiting on DNS registration stuffs so I can use Kops from my home machine).

- Determine if ""preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"" the correct setting? Other settings would prevent the pod from scheduling on the same node and I think mark the pod as un-schedulable. Since DNS is pretty critical to a cluster it is probably better to have the scheduler attempt to schedule the pod to be resilient against DNS pod crashes.

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/2717,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2717,jordanjennings,Update weave to use the correct CIDR for pods,"Per conversations on slack and discussions in #1171 and #2085, this pull request sets the IP range for weave by setting the env variable IPALLOC_RANGE to `.KubeControllerManager.ClusterCIDR`.

Everything working as expected, see below for more testing details.

## Tested Scenarios

### New Cluster Creation
- Cluster was created with this branch and k8s 1.6.2.
- Default of `nonMasqueradeCIDR: 100.64.0.0/10` was kept
- IPALLOC_RANGE in for weave validated in the state store as:
```
 env:
   - name: IPALLOC_RANGE
     value: 100.96.0.0/11
```
- Guestbook deployed, pods were given IPs in the expected range:
```
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP            NODE
guestbook-3t2l6      1/1       Running   0          7m        100.104.0.2   ip-10-253-84-250.ec2.internal
guestbook-6318f      1/1       Running   0          7m        100.120.0.2   ip-10-253-85-151.ec2.internal
guestbook-g196z      1/1       Running   0          7m        100.116.0.2   ip-10-253-85-108.ec2.internal
redis-master-ctd02   1/1       Running   0          7m        100.120.0.3   ip-10-253-85-151.ec2.internal
redis-slave-j7g0p    1/1       Running   0          7m        100.104.0.3   ip-10-253-84-250.ec2.internal
redis-slave-z0xkr    1/1       Running   0          7m        100.120.0.4   ip-10-253-85-151.ec2.internal
```

All networking working as expected (pod to pod, pod to external, external to pod)

### Cluster Upgrade
- Cluster created with kops 1.6.0 and k8s 1.6.2
- Default of `nonMasqueradeCIDR: 100.64.0.0/10` was kept
- No IPALLOC_RANGE set for weave (as expected)
- Deployed guestbook, working as expected with default weave pod IP ranges:
```
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP          NODE
guestbook-1wqfd      1/1       Running   0          1h        10.44.0.2   ip-10-253-84-75.ec2.internal
guestbook-f4pnl      1/1       Running   0          1h        10.39.0.1   ip-10-253-84-63.ec2.internal
guestbook-s2239      1/1       Running   0          1h        10.36.0.3   ip-10-253-85-167.ec2.internal
redis-master-clx2j   1/1       Running   0          1h        10.39.0.2   ip-10-253-84-63.ec2.internal
redis-slave-cjhnk    1/1       Running   0          1h        10.44.0.3   ip-10-253-84-75.ec2.internal
redis-slave-h87gj    1/1       Running   0          1h        10.39.0.3   ip-10-253-84-63.ec2.internal
```

- Cluster edited with this branch, k8s updated to 1.6.4
- `kops update cluster` showed the expected diff and I confirmed state store was updated 
- After `kops rolling-update cluster` I validated the previous deployment IP addresses:
```
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP            NODE
guestbook-1t0m3      1/1       Running   0          6m        100.124.0.4   ip-10-253-84-153.ec2.internal
guestbook-d2tt3      1/1       Running   0          6m        100.124.0.2   ip-10-253-84-153.ec2.internal
guestbook-jbzkc      1/1       Running   0          6m        100.112.0.2   ip-10-253-84-31.ec2.internal
redis-master-fzjs8   1/1       Running   0          6m        100.112.0.3   ip-10-253-84-31.ec2.internal
redis-slave-4gq9k    1/1       Running   0          6m        100.124.0.3   ip-10-253-84-153.ec2.internal
redis-slave-qpnb5    1/1       Running   0          6m        100.112.0.4   ip-10-253-84-31.ec2.internal
```
- All IP addresses now in the expected range of `100.96.0.0/11`
- All networking working as expected
- Did a new deployment of guestbook, also worked as expected

Note: the known issue with Weave 1.9.7 and NodePort services is still present here. That will be addressed separately.

It introduce the `scale` command, so the user will be able to run `scale ig --name cluster.kops.ddy.systems nodes --replicas=4` to increase the instance size. 
It run faster than the rolling update because it just change the max/desired size of instance.

For reference, here's the default values for the individual components.
```
  kubeAPIServer:
    serviceClusterIPRange: 100.64.0.0/13
  kubeControllerManager:
    # I do not think we need this with CNI
    clusterCIDR: 100.96.0.0/11
  kubeDNS:
    serverIP: 100.64.0.10
  kubeProxy:
    clusterCIDR: 100.96.0.0/11
  kubelet:
    clusterDNS: 100.64.0.10
    networkPluginName: cni
    nonMasqueradeCIDR: 100.64.0.0/10
  # these values are the base subnets that everything is setup from
  # I do not believe that these should overlap
  nonMasqueradeCIDR: 100.64.0.0/10
  serviceClusterIPRange: 100.64.0.0/13
```

Currently, we are using `.NonMasqueradeCIDR` in the wrong fashion. We
should be using `.KubeControllerManager.ClusterCIDR` instead to prevent IP
collision with Service IPs.

Note: The `.NonMasqueradeCIDR` is the cluster's base subnet, and should not be directly used by the components because of overlap.

## Scenarios Tested

### New Cluster Creation for k8s 1.6 - PASS
Deployed a new Kubernetes 1.6.4 cluster using this branch with the changes. Pods are now being allocated an IP within the 100.96.0.0/11 range (as defined by `.KubeControllerManager.ClusterCIDR` vs `.NonMasqueradeCIDR`

Tested: 
- Pod to Service IP (100.64.0.10/kube-dns and example nginx service)
-  Pod to Pod
-  Pod to External (google.com)

Observation:
- Nodes are assigned a Pod CIDR within the .KubeControllerManager.ClusterCIDR range as expected
- Pods are being assigned IPs in the proper range
- Service IP range remains unchanged

### Cluster Upgrade for k8s 1.6 (cluster first created using kops-1.6.2)

Deployed a new Kubernetes 1.6.4 cluster using kops-1.6.2, then ran kops built from this branch:
- `kops update cluster --yes` to change the CIDR.
Observation: All pods are still functional and running with the existing Pod IPs. Pod to Service IP, Pod to Pod, Pod to External (google.com) tested.

#### Upgrade strategy attempts
1. `kops rolling-update --force --yes`  to do rolling restart - FAIL
Observation: Existing Pods continue to be functional with its old Pod IPs (which may or may not lie within the newly defined IP range) while nodes are being cycled. A period of several minutes where DNS is not responsive in Pods, and shortly recovers. Not sure if it has anything to do with the CIDR change. Seems more to do with the ""rolling"" update. New Nodes are still assigned old CIDR range. Service IP range remains unchanged.

2. Deleting running calico/node pods from calico daemonset - FAIL
`kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system | grep calico-node | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod --namespace kube-system `

Observation: Existing Pods continue to be functional with its old Pod IPs. New Pods being rescheduled on existing Nodes are still getting a Pod IP in the old IP range. New Nodes are still assigned old CIDR range.

##### Failure Investigation
Calico only uses the `CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR` to create a default IPv4 pool if a pool doesn't exist already:
https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/blob/v1.3.0/calico_node/startup/startup.go#L463

Because of this, we need to run two jobs that execute calicoctl manually to migrate on the new CIDR - one to create a new IPv4 pool that we want, and one to delete the existing IP pool that we no longer want. This is to be executed after executing one of the listed upgrade strategies:

```
# This ConfigMap is used to configure a self-hosted Calico installation.

By doing that, new Pods will get new IPs in the right range, and existing Pods with existing IPs continue to function.

### Operations on k8s 1.5 using the same tests as above
- [x] New Cluster Creation for k8s 1.5 - **PASS**
- [x] Cluster Upgrade for k8s 1.5 - **SAME ISSUE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH K8S 1.6**

Current [single-to-multi-master](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/0def5cdaae9de77f67963269a2e24267910ba9ec/docs/single-to-multi-master.md) says:

- Create the third master instance group after establishing 2-masters cluster
- Add second and third master instance groups to `.spec.etcdClusters`, _even if we have not created it yet._

I tried to single-to-multi master migration with the above document, but I got an the below error:

```sh-session
$ kops update cluster
Using cluster from kubectl context: k8s.test-cluster.wantedlyapp.com


*********************************************************************************

A new kubernetes version is available: 1.5.7
Upgrading is recommended (try kops upgrade cluster)

More information: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/permalinks/upgrade_k8s.md#1.5.7

*********************************************************************************


error building tasks: InstanceGroup not found (for etcd c2/main): ""master-ap-northeast-1c-2""
```

`kops update cluster` does not accept nonexist instance group...

After creating the third master instance group with empty size, it worked well and I could finish migration successfully.

## What

Revise document to create _all_ master instance groups at first.

This adds a new element to the ClusterSpec, `EgressProxy`, and then sets up environment variables where appropriate.  Access to API servers is additionally assumed to be done through the proxy, in particular this is necessary for AWS VPCs with private topology and egress by proxy (no NAT), at least until Amazon implements VPC Endpoints for the APIs.

Additionally, see my notes in #2481

This PR includes two new strategies that influence node replacement.  The first option is the current code path. All masters and bastions are rolled sequentially before the nodes, and this flag does not control their replacement.

We are now including three new strategies that influence node replacement. All masters and bastions are rolled sequentially before the nodes, and this flag does not influence their replacement.  These strategies utilize the feature flag mentioned above.

1. ""default"" - A node is drained then deleted.  The cloud then replaces the node automatically.
2. ""create-all-new-ig-first"" - All node instance groups are duplicated first; then all old nodes are cordoned.
3. ""create-new-by-ig"" - As each node instance group rolls, the instance group is duplicated, then all old nodes are cordoned.

	The second and third options create new instance groups. In order to use this ALPHA feature
	you need to enable +DrainAndValidateRollingUpdate,+RollingUpdateStrategies feature flags.
	 

The second option pre-creates a whole new set of instance groups first, while the third option only creates a new ig as each ig is rolled.

The first and default option is the original code path.

This is a refactor of https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2621

TODO

- [x] more testing
- [ ] pick better names for strategies
- [x] figure out biz logic for cloud only and force
- [x] instance group naming is kinda monkeyed on renames.
- [x] remove docker SHA update

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/2829,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/2829,marccarre,Update weave to 2.0.1,"## Description:

Upgrade from 1.9.8 to 2.0.1, see full list of changes here:
- https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-200
- https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-201

## Steps:

As the `diff` may be hard to digest, here are the steps I followed for this PR:

1. I identified the changes made in `kops` YAML templates vs. static YAMLs provided with `weave`:

        $ curl -fsSLo 1.6.yaml https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v1.9.8/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.6.yaml
        $ curl -fsSLo 1.5.yaml https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v1.9.8/weave-daemonset.yaml
        $ diff 1.6.yaml k8s-1.6.yaml.template
        $ diff 1.5.yaml pre-k8s-1.6.yaml.template

    These highlighted the below changes:
    1. for `labels`:

            +   labels:
            +     role.kubernetes.io/networking: ""1""

    2. for `resources` (both for `weave` and `weave-npc`):

            -               cpu: 10m
            ---
            +               cpu: 100m
            +               memory: 200Mi
            +             limits:
            +               cpu: 100m
            +               memory: 200Mi

    3. for `env`:

            +           env:
            +             - name: IPALLOC_RANGE
            +               value: {{ .KubeControllerManager.ClusterCIDR }}
            +             {{- if .Networking.Weave.MTU }}
            +             - name: WEAVE_MTU
            +               value: ""{{ .Networking.Weave.MTU }}""
            +             {{- end }}

2. I then re-applied the above changes to the latest (`2.0.1`) YAML files:

        $ curl -fsSLo k8s-1.6.yaml.template https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.0.1/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.6.yaml
        $ curl -fsSLo pre-k8s-1.6.yaml.template https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.0.1/weave-daemonset.yaml

This prevents `kops` from deleting shared / user provided:

1. subnets
2. nat-gw
3. the vpc, including route-tables and dhcp-options

I am using the actual IDs because, with the upcoming phases, we may not enforce the tag names fully.  The IDs are immutable, and the tags are not.  It is super important that we do not delete shared items.  I am not changing the list function calls, as they are being used by other code, I am removing the resource before deleting.

1. cp base ami from other region following this (https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws/pull/390#issue-212435055)

## build bin

2. build a dev `dns-controller`, e.g. `DOCKER_REGISTRY=qqshfox make dns-controller-push`
3. build `nodeup`, e.g. `make nodeup-dist`
4. build `kops`, e.g. `make kops-dist`
5. put `nodeup` somewhere. e.g. 

```
aws s3 cp --acl public-read .build/dist/nodeup s3://$SOME_BUCKET/
aws s3 cp --acl public-read .build/dist/nodeup.sha1 s3://$SOME_BUCKET/

6. set env vars:

```
export AWS_REGION=cn-north-1
export NODEUP_URL=https://s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/$SOME_BUCKET/nodeup
export DNSCONTROLLER_IMAGE=qqshfox/dns-controller:1.7.0

1. Choose to add an inventory API struct value to create an interface for outputting inventory data.  Was able to use API machinery to marshall and unmarshal the structs automatically.  Customers will want to use the inventory data to track security issues from external screening systems.
1. apply_cluster.go requires an ssh key in the keystore in s3 to run.  We need to run `kops get inventory` and `kops create inventory` before a cluster exists.  I created a dummy key and then delete it in S3.  Any ideas on how to work around this would be appreciated.

This commit proposes a more sane default limit for fs.inotify.max_user_instances of 8192, since dockerd only runs under a single user.

Context and background: 

In production we kept encountering multiple problems revolving around ""too many open files"" in different locations (e.g. nginx ingress controller). 

After doing much digging, and finally reproducing the problem by running (on a node with the problem) the command ""kubectl logs -c container pod -n namespace -f"" vs no error without the -f (follow), we managed to get a meaningful and reproducible error message (""failed to create fsnotify watcher: too many open files"") and isolate the problem to the fs.inotify.max_user_instances limit for any single user.

We determined that dockerd, running under a single user, was at the default limit of 128, and by increasing this limit temporarily for testing, via:
`echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`

We confirmed the problem disappeared after multiple tests via the log follow command. We further decreased the limit back down to 128 once more and reproduced the problem via the above log follow command.

There are 2 problems:

1. Canal pods will not schedule onto dedicated instancegroups due to their too-strict tolerations. A similar fix for calico was merged recently #3097 - this is the same fix for Canal instead.
2. When booting a cluster with 1.7.0 we ran into the same issue mentioned in projectcalico/canal#77 and likely experienced in #2856. Specifically one of our dedicated instancegroups and the master nodes had no Taints attached. To mitigate we simply bump the versions of calico/node and calico/cni to match the versions that resolved projectcalico/canal#77.

When using these fixes to boot our k8s 1.7.3 cluster with this branch the Taints showed up and Calico scheduled on our masters and our dedicated IG.

Stage I
------------
A single CCM hosts all existing CloudProviders. The support for this is needed in kops to write e2e tests for CCM. 

Stage II
------------
Each cloud has its own CCM. Picking clouds becomes a change of image, instead of change of flags. I noticed DO has added support for this stage. @andrewsykim A structure needs to be put in place such that future incoming cloudproviders can easily add support for their cloud in kops. Ideally, users should be able to just set --cloud=""XYZ"" and the XYZ-CCM should be used. WDYT?

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/3416,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/3416,alrs,Makefile protokube and install default,"HI, guys.

Here's what I'm up to with the Makefile:

A Makefile looks like the world's most stunted scripting environment, and perhaps it is. What a Makefile is really good at is creating a dependency graph. I've been replacing PHONY targets with targets that create an in-tree artifact so that `make` can do its job and keep track of what has been built, and then only build the things that don't exist or are older than the other artifacts that they depend on.

In the near-term this fixes the Makefile targets that wouldn't build unless you'd manually run some other `make` directive first.

In the longer-term it gets `kops` to the point where you can run `make` with the `-j` flag and run multiple concurrent `make` processes simultaneously, so targets that are CPU dependent aren't waiting for targets that are slowed by a network bottleneck.

I've pulled the recent @justinsb Makefile change out, because the `kops-dev` target drops a binary out-of-tree where `make` can't keep track of it, and it changes `make all` to only built kops instead of all the binaries.

It looked like the important thing in the recent commit was to have the development build of kops land in `$GOPATH/bin` automatically. In this PR I change `install` to be the first target in the Makefile, so kops, nodeup, channels, and protokube all get built and copied into `$GOPATH/bin` by default.

This is a little weird, because usually with a Makefile you do everything within your local directory structure, and then save `make install` for the one target that can wander off and clobber stuff on the rest of the system. I'm happy for it to be the default if that's what you guys prefer.

This PR also adds the `${PROTOKUBE}` target to the PHONY `make all`.

Once this passes CI I plan on assigning it to @justinsb so as to be sure there are no surprises.",['justinsb'],4,2017-09-19 01:39:52,2017-09-21 06:47:37,2017-09-21 06:47:37,False,,,unknown,,closed

This implements the functionality to re-use shared security groups.  Often security departments will not allow a user to create specific security groups, and this allows for shared / re-used groups.

Update - I removed Update - I removed https://github.com/chrislovecnm/kops/commit/7688be0ec6338a6420702d6d433a8391e61b916d

We have dependencies between security groups.   I have code that allows for the dependant group to be modified, which is basically the modification of shared security groups.  When that happens the cluster cannot be deleted.  I am really leaning toward no having that complication.

Instead of modifying other security groups, I recommend we require the security groups.  We would remove the above SHA and implement validation

1. You always need master and node groups - if you use shared security groups
2. If you have bastion, you need API bastion group

TODO 

- [x] test with ELB and API

- [x] add documentation

This is WIP, but the code is stable and ready for review.

This ng Makefile has only been tested with the `ci` and `version-dist` targets. Most other targets have been removed to be added back individually.

This Makefile builds all of the distributable binaries in Docker containers that mount the source tree read-only. This protects the source tree from root-owned artifacts and strange side-effects from inside containers.

This Makefile uses templates to build most of the binaries, which DRYs out the build targets substantially.

This Makefile does not use `.PHONY` for non-phony targets.

This Makefile uses `pigz` instead of `gzip` if available, which uses all cores and is considerably faster.

`make -f NG.mk -j 3 ci version-dist` is concurrency-safe and allows tests to run while `kubectl` and required Docker containers are downloaded in the background.

This Makefile has been tested to work with GNU Make 3.8 and 4.1.

Where possible, Docker containers have been changed to use the `debian:stretch-slim` image, as it is the same size as the existing image but a newer release of Debian. This isn't done for the `utils-builder-ng` image, as `socat` doesn't build using the provided incantation of `gcc` flags on Debian stable.

During development of this branch, I've turned on full-VM support in Travis-CI and tested that `make -f NG.mk version-dist` will spin up build containers and create the expected artifacts. It does.

This Makefile tweaks the layout of the `.build` directory. This will most likely not be an issue as new `upload-` targets are written to the new layout, but I'm all ears if the old way of having multiple copies of each binary was necessary for some reason.

I have tested and this now correctly covers CoreOS by resolving the following bugs (I don't believe any issues were raised for these):
- Docker config file was located in `/etc/sysconfig/docker` as opposed to `/etc/default/docker`
- The `/etc/lsb-release` file exists for CoreOS, so the bootstrap script was incorrectly attempting to write proxy settings into the apt proxy config file

These changes should cover CoreOS, Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat distributions including CentOS and Fedora.

## Use Cases

This improvement of phases and lifecycles will allow a user to:

1. allows users to have complex networking patterns that kops does not support out of the box: no IG, custom nat gw, vpn, etc
2. allows users to just run a single phase w/o dependencies
3. allows users to output tf for certain sections of phase
4. allow users to have validation fail, but still run kops

## Design

### Phase / Lifecycle Improvement

Break down lifecycles and corresponding phases into:

1. IAM - already exists
1. Network - already exists, but need to remove components
1. Security Groups - new, pretty self explanitory
1. Cluster - exists already but has too much in it
1. ELB - new will include ELBs and DNS, if required

The implementation will consist of new phases and lifecycles

### Capability for kops to fail validation but run

Currently, if kops fails validation in a lifecycle it will not run.  Along with these lifecycles, I am recommending a mode where a user can allow for validation to fail.  

I would like to introduce into kops a cli or API mapping that allows users to fail particular phase validation.  We can start with the cli options, but with a kops server, I think we will need it in the API.

An idea

```
kops update cluster --phase cluster --allow-validate-fail=iam,network
```

This would run update cluster and allow the IAM and network validation to fail.  But security groups validation would need to pass.

## This PR - test cases

This is creating the tests for the reworking of phases, and the work allowing failed validation.  The cluster test, for instance, will not pass, until we allow for kops phase validation to fail, but then still allow `kops update` to run.

The TF files are pretty solid for the tests, once the work has been completed.  I filed a couple of other issues in regards to no DNS for the bastion exists, and the outputs are also clashing with each other if you have TF broken into the Phases.

Setting this ""false"" sets protokube to a container, which is staged in a registry.  The other option is that protokube is always staged in a registry. The reason users need protokube in a registry is for security screening.

AssetsBuilder needs to know where to put protokube this flag allows that.

---

The implementation replaces AWS Auto Scaling groups (and in the future also GCE Instance Groups) with Spotinst Elastigroups, so the only part that is different from the AWS/GCE implementation is the compute part. For example, creating an IAM role using the Spotinst provider is exactly the same as creating it using the AWS provider, behind the scenes the role is created by `awsup.AWSCloud` in both implementations.

Currently, this implementation duplicates all AWS tasks and replaces every `cloud.(awsup.AWSCloud)` with `cloud.(*spotinst.SpotinstCloud).CloudProvider().(awsup.AWSCloud)` which implemented as follows:

```go
type SpotinstCloud struct {
    Cloud   fi.Cloud // awsup.AWSCloud or gce.GCECloud
    Service elastigroup.Service
}

func NewSpotinstCloud(cluster *kops.Cluster) (*SpotinstCloud, error) {
    cloudProviderID := GuessCloudFromClusterSpec(&cluster.Spec)
    if cloudProviderID == """" {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(""spotinst: unable to infer cloud provider from spec"")
    }

    var cloud fi.Cloud
    var err error

    switch cloudProviderID {
    case kops.CloudProviderAWS, kops.CloudProviderGCE:
        cloud, err = buildCloud(cloudProviderID, cluster)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
    default:
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(""spotinst: unknown cloud provider: %s"", cloudProviderID)
    }

    ...
    ...
    ...

    return &SpotinstCloud{
        Cloud:   cloud,
        Service: elastigroup.New(session.New(config)),
    }, nil
}

func (c *SpotinstCloud) CloudProvider() fi.Cloud {
    return c.Cloud
}

...
...
...
```

This is done in order to overcome the reflection error raised by `cloud.(awsup.AWSCloud)` while the concrete value held by the `fi.Cloud` interface is actually `*spotinst.SpotinstCloud`.

I'm not sure whether there is a better way to implement this, but I had to do it since all tasks (except for Spotinst Elastigroups) need to receive `awsup.AWSCloud` while the `fi.Cloud` built by kops when using `--cloud spotinst` is actually `*spotinst.SpotinstCloud`.

Do you have an idea how can I improve this approach?

---

Once the cluster is created and nodes are spawned, there is no need to run Spotinst as a `cloud-controller-manager` cause the underlying cloud provider is either AWS or GCE, which is already handled by the current implementation of the existing `kube-controller-manager`. Since the cloud provider defined in `Cluster.Spec` doesn't match to the cloud provider defined in some components I had to change the validation code so this conflict won't fail the validation:

```go
...
if c.Spec.Kubelet != nil && (strict || c.Spec.Kubelet.CloudProvider != """") {
    if c.Spec.Kubelet.CloudProvider != ""external"" && k8sCloudProvider != c.Spec.Kubelet.CloudProvider && kops.CloudProviderID(c.Spec.CloudProvider) != kops.CloudProviderSpotinst {
        return field.Invalid(fieldSpec.Child(""Kubelet"", ""CloudProvider""), c.Spec.Kubelet.CloudProvider, ""Did not match cluster CloudProvider"")
    }
}
...

- https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/3770/commits/74b33ea6ff3f1066e72b5aefd3dc18aa24f6856a had to move `EnsureFileOwner` into its own go file, and not have it compiled for windows.  It is only used by nodeup.  This is the only code change.
- added various dependencies
- renamed Sirupsen to sirupsen, as docker has it as sirupsen in some of its code
- added target in the Makefile, and updated existing targets

### Background

Kubernetes 1.8 removed the `pod.beta.kubernetes.io/init-containers` annotation in favor of the `initContainers` spec that was added in kubernetes 1.6. 

The effect on kube-router daemonset is that the config file is not dropped in /etc/cni/net.d, kubelet fails to init the network and node is never marked as ready. The solution is pretty simple, just move the annotation to the new initContainers spec.

Namely the ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH and ETCD_PEER_CERT_AUTH which effectively tell etcd to enforce verification of the client certificate. This fix for this is very easy, the rollout on a cluster which TLS already enabled it somewhat trickier. The fix is 

* recreate the certificate for the peers to have both server and client keyusage
* switch on the environment variables to true

On a rollout this is somewhat annoying as all etcd peers must have the updated certificate before the you can enable the feature. 

At first glance this should pose an issue for rollout as on the first master node we update TLS auth, the other etcd nodes will be blocked from connecting as their certificate hasn't been updated yet. This I figured would break the cluster validation code and ergo rollout. But after some testing, the [cluster validation](https://github.com/gambol99/kops/blob/etcd_options/pkg/validation/validate_cluster.go#L88-L133) doesn't actually check the node status, it checks for pod failures but etcd would continue without pod failures, instead throwing TLS errors when peers attempt to connect without the updated certificate. To take an example on a 3 node cluster, first one breaks (i.e. other two cannot continue) but rollout continues, second is updated and forms with first node, third is broken but fixed on the final update. Note, I'm still a little concerned that timing and load could cause issues here, my testing we done a test ephemeral cluster.Hence I've kept a toggle flag in the PR for now so we can discuss.

- Strategies can be specified / override on the command and or they can be added to the InstanceGroups themselves
- The PR is written with the intent of Kops API server rather than a CLI, thus added error signalling and cancellation to rollouts
- The default rollout is retained, one by one with or without a drain. Note, drain is now a option rather than an experimental feature which can be used across any of the rollout strategies. 
- Rollouts can occur in batches of X instances and you can limits rollouts to a specific count of Y. i.e you want to test a rollout but only Y instances with a instancegroup.
- Instancegroup can also be rollout out concurrently via the node-batch option 
- Added a duplication strategy which copies the group and removes the source
- Added a scale-up strategy which scales the instancegroup by 2, can drain and scales back

This change is unnecessary for Canal deployments for the following reasons:
- Calico's `DefaultEndpointToHostAction` is set to `ACCEPT` in the manifest deployed by kops, allowing traffic by default once all other Calico rules are processed.
- If Calico's `ChainInsertMode` is set to `APPEND`, the flannel rules will be processed before the Calico rules, accepting traffic by default, and so Kubernetes network policies will not take effect

This change is temporary until a more permanent resolution is available with Flannel, such as providing a configurable option to disable the addition of these rules when deployed with Calico.

For a private subnet (no internet gateway), you can add a specific NAT gateway using `egress` or by default a NAT gateway will be added to **utility** subnet and a route in the private subnet for this NAT gateway.

Further, a config with multiple availability zone on AWS and a private topology will create private subnet and utility subnet for every availability zone. A routing table for every single subnet will be created. That is offer very good flexibility of route customisation for every subnet.

But for a public topology, one  public routing table will be created for all public subnets and attached to them. This pull request will create a routing table per public subnet to add more flexibility to the routes customisation for subnets if you don't config with private topology.

The `egress` of `cluster.Spec.Subnets` allow only precreated NAT gateway instead of creating a new one. The pull request will allow multiple routes of precreated NAT gateway, NAT instances and VPC peering connections for `egress` field. It will be a list of routes each has `cidr` for route destination  and either `instance` or `vpcPeeringConnection`. For `natGateway` the route destination CIDR will be `0.0.0.0/0`. Further the `natGateway` will be only allowed for **private** subnets.

Example:
```yaml
spec:
  subnets:
  - cidr: 10.20.64.0/21
    name: us-east-1a
    egress:
    - vpcPeeringConnection: pcx-123456
      cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
    - natGateway: nat-123456      // The old 'egress' field; not allowd in Private subnet
    - instance: i-123456
      cidr: 10.1.1.1/16
    type: Private
    zone: us-east-1a
  - cidr: 10.20.32.0/21
    name: utility-us-east-1a
    id: subnet-12345
    type: Utility
    zone: us-east-1a
    egress:
    - vpcPeeringConnection: pcx-123456
      cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
```
 
This will allow to route traffic to specific CIDR through a customised NAT instances and NAT gateways. Furthermore, it will allow to route traffic to another peered VPC. Ability of a cluster to access another VPC resources (or another AWS account resources) seems to be interesting feature.

Added support for `--oidc-username-prefix` and `--oidc-groups-prefix`.
By passing these it's possible to override the default prefixes used to map the OIDC user with the username in kubernetes.

### See
See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server

### IMPORTANT
I'm far from a kubernetes/KOPS, this is not tested so someone needs to have a look and see if something is missing or if this can cause troubles! (don't want to accidentally cause the destruction of the universe 💥 )

It's basically the same done in this other PR: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/1438/files

I did **not** change the `zz_generated.conversion.go` files as according to comment at the top of them they're autogenerated:
```go
// This file was autogenerated by conversion-gen. Do not edit it manually!
```
(I wonder if they should be `.gitignore`d)

### Fixes

```
Continue? (Y)es, (N)o, (A)lwaysYes: [Y]

This enables the use of KMS and CMK for S3 as default on a bucket.

Currently, [kops sets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/dd49d693995d7e54ee738e677de21ad4f6d70c5d/util/pkg/vfs/s3fs.go#L120) the encryption to AES256 when writing to S3. This client-side option overrides the default encryption that might be set on the bucket.

This PR checks for the environment variable `KOPS_STATE_S3_DEFAULT_ENC` is set to `TRUE`. If that is the case, the encryption option is omitted when writing to S3.

Guideline for the PR: We don't want to break existing users, so we should keep it that if you do nothing you are still encrypted.

An alternative implementation that omits the ugly `KOPS_STATE_S3_DEFAULT_ENC`: check if the bucket has ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault=true, if so then don't set ServerSideEncryption on the object, so we get the bucket policy.  If it isn't set, set ServerSideEncryption on the object as today.","['justinsb', 'robinpercy']",1,2018-01-09 10:18:43,2018-06-10 21:39:01,2018-06-10 21:39:02,False,,,dirty,False,closed

This change exposes the ""--fail-swap-on"" flag for kubelet. This means that in the cluster config yaml, you can set `failSwapOn: true | false` under the kubelet config. More info on this option can be found in the referenced issue (#4123), in the kubernetes docs [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubelet/), and in the kubernetes github issue [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/47181).

A positive side-effect is it also allows using wildcards in name.

- `k8s-1.8-2018-01-02`
- `k8s-1.8-2018-01-14` 

You can specify `account_id/k8s-1.8-*` and kops will use the ami for `k8s-1.8-2018-01-14`.

`account_id/k8s-1.8-2017-*` returns `k8s-1.8-2017-12-15`

A simple fix following 2 days of debugging.

The problem was the CCM needs DNS to start first, since it needs DNS to talk to AWS api. However, until CCM removes the `k8s.io....cloudprovider: uninitialized` taint, DNS cannot be run (kubelet taints node when started with cloudProvider: external). This deadlock was stopping the k8s cluster from starting up. This PR fixes this.

From what I can tell, you can now do `make bazel-upload` and things work end to end as they would with `make upload`.  

I kept bazel-upload, etc. separate since I didn't want to change any existing build stuff, though this should certainly be refactored.

This also pulls in distroless_rules and debian stretch package management utils to build the protokube container with bazel. I'm not sure if this is 100% what we should do but it works well in dev from my testing.

> Starting from Kubernetes 1.8, resource usage metrics, such as container CPU and memory usage, are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API. These metrics can be either accessed directly by user, for example by using `kubectl top` command, or used by a controller in the cluster, e.g. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, to make decisions.

The metrics server is not available in a Kubernetes cluster (unless it's been brought up by `kube-up.sh` and that's only 1.8+). So it's good to have it here. This complements HPA documentation that will be added by https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/3942.

See https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/pull/32 also. It's not necessary for end user but useful for context around the compatibility matrix.

* fixed a bug in s3 vfs where the relative path can be an empty string
* disabled SSE if a custom S3 endpoint is provided - having it enabled was breaking my setup but I'm not sure how common it is to have SSE supported on a custom endpoint, I can remove it if you think it'll be a problem for anyone else using custom S3 endpoints.

It has some desirable characteristics like no extra pods to run, less overhead by using ipvlan etc.

I've been on a journey that started with just baking the extra config and binaries on top of the kops ami which was less than savory since I had to do acrobatics to try and get --node-ip into the kubelet args and get the templating of the cni conflist done at just the right time during instance startup. It worked but was quite unsatisfying.
I considered porting that work over to using the additional user-data / hooks capabilities but that also left me feeling unsatisfied with basically doing the same acrobatics in a harder to work with format and prone to being broken by upstream changes in the future
I decided then to undertake adding support for the plugin in kops using the AmazonVPC work as a starting point.

I've arrived at this and it works great for our clusters.

This does break slightly with the other CNI plugins in that it's not really an addon. Which I think is a positive thing overall.

There are some things that I've done in the code that might not be in quite the right place. I'll call them out inline

I wanted to get this work out there to solicit feedback and hopefully get this to a state that can be adopted so we don't have to maintain this in a  fork forever.

true, in the hope of fixing some of the edge-case controller issues.

However, while this is cheap on etcd3, that fix was not backported to
etcd2, and performance there of quorum reads is poor.

For non-HA clusters with etcd2, it still goes through raft, but does not
need to - we set etcd-quorum-read to false, as this is just a missed
optimization in etcd2.

For HA clusters with etcd2, it's trickier, but at least for now we're
going to avoid the (crippling) performance regression.  kops 1.10 should
have etcd-manager (allowing upgrades to etcd3), and the ability to

Compatible with instructions here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/gpu.md

===
* Changed Dockerfile base image to debian for systemctl and bash.
* Added autodetect of AWS ec2 instanceclass p2, p3, g3.
* For each detected instance class, added the installation of the proper driver
  according to the specific NVIDIA hardware.
  - G3 instance types require Nvidia Grid Series/Grid K520 drivers
  - P2 instance types require Nvidia Tesla K-Series drivers
  - P3 instance types require Nvidia Tesla V-Series drivers
* Set custom nvidia-smi configurations according to nvidia hardware per ec2
  instanceclass, according to the AWS GPU optimization document.
* Added the installation and patches of the latest cuda 9.1 libraries.
* Added restart of kubelet on kube node at end of successful hook run, thereby
  fixing a race condition where kubelet would start before the Nvidia drivers
  were loaded, thus not allowing kubernetes to detect GPUS on the kube node.
* Ensured build of nvidia drivers used same gcc version as that which built
  default kops kernel.
* Fixed issue where *every* run of this container would download all the NVIDIA
  drivers + cuda libs (1GB+), by caching the files on the kube node.
* Fixed issue where after reboot, subsequent runs of this script would fail
  because mknod would try to create a previously-created device node and fail.
  This previously caused download loop as systemd perpetually restarted the
  unit upon failure.
* Tested with p2.xlarge, p3.2xlarge, and g3.4xlarge","['justinsb', 'rdrgmnzs', 'mikesplain']",2,2018-04-11 19:47:35,2018-07-21 00:17:43,2018-07-24 15:36:13,True,2018-07-21 00:17:43,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

The main difference here is that the `nodeipam` controller is disabled if `--cloud-provider=external` but still enabled when `--cloud-provider=""""`. This was required to accommodate for the fact that GCE does IPAM allocations via API calls so we needed a mechanism to disable it on the KCM during the transition. kubelet's should still have still set `--cloud-provider=external`.

I've added a `useRawManifest` option to the hook spec which causes the `manifest` to
be installed as a systemd unit with no modifications.

I've also changed the logic around naming of the unit files. Where previously the hook
system would append "".service"" to the name of the unit file if it didn't end in "".service"" or
"".timer"", it now instead checks for any valid systemd unit file extension. It still appends
"".service"" if no valid extension is found, to maintain backwards compatibility. Note that
this could break backwards-compatibility for users who are relying on the "".service""
extension for hooks with names that overlap the set of systemd extensions; for example,
a hook named ""my-hook.slice"" will no longer be installed as ""my-hook.slice.service"",
because "".slice"" is a valid unit file extension.

The change is accompanied by updated documentation and unit tests around the
extension change.

a) The current implementation use's a static kubelet which doesn't not conform to the Node authorization mode (i.e. `system:nodes:<nodename>`)
b) At present the kubeconfig is static and reused across all the masters and nodes
c) Attempting the first step of moving to using to bootstrap token's in a non-evasion manner. 

The PR firstly introduces the ability for users to use bootstrap tokens and secondly when enabled ensures the kubelets for the masters as have unique usernames.  Note, this PR does not attempt to address the distribution of the bootstrap tokens themselves, leaving that to cluster admins for now and another PR.

Notes:
- the master nodes do not use bootstrap tokens, instead given they have access to the ca anyhow, we generate certificates for each.
- when bootstrap token is not enabled the behaviour will stay the same; i.e. a kubelet configuration brought down from the store.
- when bootstrap tokens are enabled, the Nodes sit in a timeout loop waiting for the configuration to appear (by third party).
- given the nodeup docker and manifests builders are executed before the kubelet builder, the assumption here is a unit file kicks of a custom container to bootstrap the rest.
- the current firewalls on between the master and nodes are fairly open so no need to open ports between the two
- much of the work was ported from @justinsb PR [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/4134/)
- we add a very presumptuous server and client certificates for use with an authorizer (node-authorizer-internal.dns_zone)

I do have an additional PR which performs the entire thing. The process being a node_authorizer which runs on the master nodes via a daemonset, the service implements a series of authorizers (i.e. alwaysallow, aws, gce etc). For aws, the process is similar to how vault authorizes nodes (https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html).

I've verified with bootstrap enabled the masters are unaffected and the certificates contains

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/5317,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/5317,gambol99,Node Authorization Service,"A previous [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/5253) added the ability to enable the bootstrap tokens. Note the feature is isolated and regardless of this PR can still be enabled and used (albeit they will have to implement their own means of token distribution). This PR adds on top of https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/5253 and provides an authorization service which runs on the masters. The service is responsible for receiving request from nodes (who's identity is verified via a chosen means) and issues a bootstrap token to the node registration. The bootstrap is part of the `system:node-bootstrapper` group and can request a CSR via that. Note, turning on NodeAuthorization we also default to using the NodeAdmission controller providing extra security by apply a filter on the requests from a node (_i.e. you can't request something that isn't scheduled on the node)_

For aws, the nodes are verified in the following manner
- the pkcs7 signed identity document available only from the node metadata service is passed in the request.
- the instance is checked as running, inside the region, part of the cluster via a tag and then check that the node is not already registered.
- assuming everyone is cool a bootstrap token is given (this at present is auto-approval, though think about it I meant add it as an optional thing)

I've tried to break up the commits in logical order make reviewing easier.

2. Enables setting the mtu explicitly in the config as:
```
  networking:

```

Testing done:

1. Created cluster on AWS with networking set to calico. No additional details were provided. Verified that the mtu was set to 8198. Also verified that the FELIX_IPINIPMTU environment variable was set to 8198.
2. Created a cluster explicitly setting the calico mtu to 2048. Verified that the mtu for the 'cali*' interfaces inside the pods was set to 2048. Also, verified that the FELIX_IPINIPMTU environment variable was set to 2048.
3. make test passed.

Having previously set up `heptio-authenticator-aws` manually, I am delighted to have support baked into KOPS 1.10.

However, after creating a cluster and deployed a `ConfigMap` I expected the `heptio-authenticator-aws` Pod to transition to a `Running` STATUS. However, checking the logs revealed that the container was unable to read the pre generated certificate.

```
$ kubectl get po -n kube-system

```

Turns out the container runs as user `aws-iam-authenticator`, so does not have permission to read the certificate, which is owned by `root` and has permissions of `600`.

Changing the permissions to `644` resolved the issue.

References:
* [Renamed ""Heptio Authenticator"" to ""AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes""](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator/pull/104)
* [Renamed heptio-authenticator-aws -> aws-iam-authenticator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator/pull/108)

This PR is an initial attempt at this. Tests pass but I have not yet created a cluster from a local build.

The changes so far are cosmetic and some questions remain:

1. Should the spec change? If so, then to what?
The `AuthenticationSpec` retains a key called `Heptio` of type `HeptioAuthenticationSpec`.

2. What about addon resources? See 1.
The `aws-iam-authenticator` manifest(s) are in a directory called `authentication.hept.io`.

3. Binary has changed but no new docker image pushed as of yet.
The docker image remains: `gcr.io/heptio-images/authenticator:v0.3.0`, so the binary will still be `heptio-authenticator-aws`. Updated images will likely be published very soon.

The reason to add this flag is to mitigate the issues happening in the watch logic using the python-kubernetes library: https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python-base/issues/57

The reason of the previous issue is that the watch connections timeout and a bug in kubernetes-python code makes any watch throw exception. A temporal solution is to extend the minRequestTimeout flag in kube-apiserver, and thus I'm needing this flag in Kops until the real solution is implemented. (I tested this flag in a local kubeadm installation and works well, but I need now to deploy it in production)

I used the guidelines in the developers documentation to create the PR code. Also, waasn't sure where in the `KubeAPIServerConfig` structe should I put the new lines to keep it organized, but as it doesn't fit with etcd or auth configuration I just added it separately in the end. If needed, tell me and I move it to a more fitting place in the list.

BTW, it's my first collaboration in the project, so, if there is anything I should change, to which branch I should merge or anything, do not hesitate to tell me about it :)

Anyways, thanks for this great framework! 👍

Including this snippet inside a kops manifest a user can get a mask size for pods different than `/24`, and so an effective `maxPods` limit over the default `150`. Cilium is only an example in this snippet. The option is generally available and documented in `kube-controller-manager`.

What I was trying to achieve was not to include the cluster name, so
for the case of subnets this commit just uses the subnet name from the
cluster spec, which should be unique and stable.  That is hopefully at
least as meaningful.

Thankfully we hadn't released a version with the erroneous naming.

Without this fix, the interactive flag is silently ignored.

Why is this change needed: it's not currently obvious the interactive mode does not always work. Also, I'd say interactive rolling update is *most useful* when the validation is turned off or the upgrade is cloud only.

Originally there were four (!) cases with only the penultimate one using the interactive prompt:
- bastion upgrade
- cluster instance with cloudonly
- cluster instance with validation
- cluster instance with validation turned off

This PR only adds the prompt after removing any cluster node. Bastion nodes still do not prompt.

As for the implementation:
- The first commit puts the prompt as the very last step for each node. I've intentionally left the `continue` after bastion upgrade to not trigger the prompt.
- The second commit as merely cosmetical and make output consistent with `DeleteInstance` method

Tests: there were no tests in the original pr #4166 and I'm not quite sure how to test this on CI. I've run the upgrade locally though and the command works as expected.

I'd say the pull requests should be listed with the original subjects, even if they include a typo. Very likely the typos are even intentional, such as in 

> * [instance_groups.md] typo: recieve->receive AdamDang 5152

It lists files in `docs/releases` and for each release, it removes lines matching a pull request. Intentionally the files are not changed inplace, as I feel running tests should not change any files. Instead, it writes to `.build/docs`, because a/ it's already git ignored b/ gets cleaned with `make clean`

The bash is slightly more convoluted than it seemingly has to be, but it's an intentional workaround macOS sed and it's wrong behavior with `-i''`.

This changes the output of the misspell command, which may be confusing:
```console
$ make verify-misspelling
./.build/docs/1.10-NOTES.md:50:28: ""foo"" is a misspelling of ""bar""

The kubelet timeout is 2m (120sec) by default to detect health problems. Secondly, the docker restart can load heavily the host OS even huge systems because of many pods initialization at the same time. Continuous dockerd restart loop - a deadlock of node - is observed. Thirdly, because of the forcibly closed sockets and the kernel TCP TIME_WAIT value, the TCP sockets are not usable immediately with a ""restart"", wait for FIN_TIMEOUT is necessary before start services.

Thus master nodes which have not been rolled yet and thus haven't pulled down the certificates via nodeup will fail.

This will keep user experience standard by creating working clusters when using existing subnets but also allows power users to manually manage tags if they wish.

API documentation never existed (in apimachinery). Previous versions probably ignored the field but while testing v1.12.1 I noticed canal no longer deployed correctly due to the validation error. I've bumped the versions and removed the field from the manifest; this shouldn't have any impact on those already deployed, but as an alternative we could copy and paste 1.8 manifest, add an exclusion in the [bootstrapchannelbuilder.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/upup/pkg/fi/cloudup/bootstrapchannelbuilder.go#L685-L699) to use >1.8.0 <=1.12.0 etc and use new manifest for >=1.12.0 (if you get what i know :-))

Post removing the `description` field the networking works again ..

This happens because of an incorrect value (nil, actually) returns from [this](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/e5b2b9eddbfa6a257ea1b1b6a6850b1f10316c16/upup/pkg/fi/cloudup/awstasks/securitygroup.go#L100-L107) function, although there is no reason for it to be done this way since the VPC ID is only used in [L115](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/e5b2b9eddbfa6a257ea1b1b6a6850b1f10316c16/upup/pkg/fi/cloudup/awstasks/securitygroup.go#L115).

This PR eliminates ths spurious change by allowing the find function to be executed even without a VPC ID.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Edit the instance group by adding an additional security group:

```yaml
apiVersion: kops/v1alpha2
kind: InstanceGroup
spec:
  additionalSecurityGroups:
  - sg-<REDACTED#2>
```

2. Update the cluster. In the logs you'll see thw following change:

```
Elastigroup/nodes.<cluster_name>
        SecurityGroups           [name:nodes.<cluster_name> id:sg-<REDACTED#1>] -> [name:nodes.<cluster_name> id:sg-<REDACTED#1>, name:sg-<REDACTED#2> id:sg-<REDACTED#2>]
```

3. Update the cluster once again and you'll see the same output, which is a result of a spurious change. ",['KashifSaadat'],2,2018-11-01 00:18:02,2018-11-08 19:15:49,2018-11-08 19:15:49,True,2018-11-08 19:15:49,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

> Clearly I'm not impartial here, but I can tell you that we test Calico to 5K nodes.
> We recommend BGP route reflectors once you go above ~50-100 nodes (we test up to 100 nodes without RRs).  The reason for RRs is that by default calico sets up BGP connections in a full mesh - clearly the number of connections will scale as the number of nodes squared.  With RRs, the number of BGP connections scales linearly with nodes - but then you have to manage the RRs too.
> The next version of Calico (v3.3 - code is in master already, but not heavily tested yet) will bring a feature to make RRs much easier to deploy - just annotate a few nodes and they become RRs.

Changes made in this PR are here to achieve what is described in the issue: please read it to understand what is done here.

I am aware this might not be the perfect PR since I did not add any unit test for those changes (well, I looked for it and for similar parts of the code, like for the `defaultUlimit` parameter and could not find any). Sorry about that.



PS : Furthermore I have the feeling that many more docker options (see list https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/) might be useful to people and that it could be nice to be able to pass them via a generic entry in the yaml spec together with sysctl options like:
```

  - ""true""

* I imported the [awsutils package](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/tree/f52ad45/pkg/awsutils) from the VPC CNI plugin with the thought of avoiding maintaining values separate from the plugin. It adds a dependency, so let me know if it's not the best way.
* I added the `seen` map to machine_types.go, because the Pricing API was doing weird things, where it returned the same instance family multiple times (in some cases, up to 3 times).

Also, @justinsb added [a comment in the original PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/5510/files/92fd86f04a866b0965b2ced91a631b588b458c53#r217738085) about possibly lowering the MaxPods. I didn't make any changes here, but let me know if I should try to incorporate that. One one hand, if there are performance penalties with large numbers of pods, it sounds like the defaults should protect cluster operators from shooting themselves in the foot; OTOH, there may(?) exist legitimate use cases that people may have many small pods and want to pack more pods. Should it be a flag to allow folks to opt into running more pods than recommended (110 per node?)","['justinsb', 'chrisz100']",7,2018-11-08 08:24:31,2018-11-26 20:39:13,2018-11-27 03:45:20,True,2018-11-26 20:39:12,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

This PR is a first stab / POC of adding the feature and enabling users to automount the devices into the nodes. The primary motivation / use case for us at least was the separate our `/var/lib/docker` into another disk and to enable encryption. Note, as the volumes provisioning and mounting are two separate features, you can reuse the mounting for instance storage as well.

Notes: the current scope of this is limited to AWS with the intention of adding support other cloud provider later.

It's very easy to overlook this as a ""newbie"" or somebody who skims through stuff (not saying that's OK, but people will be that way regardless). So, this introduces setting it to `false` by default on new cluster creation.

* Closes https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/5770.
* Closes https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/6160 (possibly, that issue has very little detail).

Fixes to issues caused by changes in v0.3.x, see release notes:

* https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.3.0
* https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.3.1

Main issue is that in 0.3.x, the secure kubelet port with auth is enabled by default. Use of the insecure port is deprecated and may even be removed as soon as the next release.

That said, metrics-server now uses webhook authentication so kubelet would need webhook authentication enabled (which we don’t). This flag enables, that serviceaccount tokens to be used to authenticate against the kubelet: See:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/
* kubernetes#5508
* kubernetes#5176 (comment)
* kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server#175

Currently, even if we were to use certificates, this provides a challenge since metrics server will generate it’s own self-signed certificates since we don’t set `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file`. Related:

* kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server#25
* kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server#146

That said, based on the comment in https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/commit/8ba93eeda5f5fb660367c0da8d454f98e38aba28, do you think it's worth enabling webhook authentication on kubelet instead of doing it this way?","['justinsb', 'chrisz100']",2,2018-12-12 09:39:34,2019-03-17 10:15:10,2019-03-18 10:23:11,True,2019-03-17 10:15:10,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

This change adds the ability to specify the pod memory and CPU requests on a per-etcd-cluster basis so that we can up our requests.  It also adds a default 200m CPU to etcd clusters named `main`, and 100m otherwise.  100Mi of memory is always assigned by default.  This should match prior functionality.

Two new options open up for etcd cluster configuration.  `cpuRequest` and `memoryRequest`.  These, when set, of course override the defaults described here.

There are plenty of things I can see that could be improved, like using a constant for the default memory and CPU.  I just wasn't sure where to put it.

I have been testing using the changes which have been in a conversation here:
drekle#1

I plan on raising 3 PR's which encompass all of the changes I have in a develop branch
https://github.com/drekle/kops/tree/develop
where each of the other two branches require changes requested here.  These include a protokube implementation as well as one additional argument required for create_cluster to specify the openstack volume type to be used for the etcd master volumes.

I have been testing with these several branches merged together.  Which is in the full PR here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/6351

One of these PR's should be closed.

kops,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/pulls/6347,https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/6347,tsuna,Add support for Docker 18.09.3.,"Starting from Docker 18.09.0, the Docker distribution has been split in
3 packages: the Docker daemon, the Docker CLI, and for containerd.  This
adds a twist to how to upgrade Docker from the base image as the daemon
and CLI packages must be installed at the same time, otherwise dpkg/rpm
will refuse to upgrade (the new CLI is incompatible with the old package
and the daemon can't be installed without first installing the CLI and
the new containerd, so the upgrade MUST happen in a single transaction).

This code change thus adds the possibility to specify sources for the
CLI and containerd in nodeup, and the ability to apply the multi-package
upgrade atomically with dpkg/rpm.

Note: I tested this on one of my kops clusters in AWS.

This setting was hardcoded, and thus root EBS volumes were always terminated. This is my first pass at enabling this as a configurable option in the `InstanceGroup` API. 

I implemented this by adding a new field to the `InstanceGroup` spec `retainVolumeOnTermination` per @justinsb recommendation. This field is then compared, and if set, the value for root volume termination is derived from it. Else, it's set to the default of always deleting the root volume when the instance is terminated.

Unsure if I need tests for this flow, but I have tested each possibility. I am also unsure if this needs to be implemented for the other block device mappings, or if we should leave it as root ebs only given my use case.",[],17,2019-01-22 03:21:35,,2019-03-20 03:46:44,False,,,unstable,True,open

```

This will also create a `nodetasks.File` for the directory. This uses `EnsureTask` but unfortunately the `kubelet.go` runs after so raises an error with duplicate tasks.
