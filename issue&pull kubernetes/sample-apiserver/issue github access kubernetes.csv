sample-apiserver,ychen-atlassian,https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver/pull/21,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sample-apiserver/issues/21,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook issue demonstration,"Steps:

1. Start up sample-apiserver with the provided rc.yaml. yiyangc91/kube-sample-apiserver:latest points to the a build of sample-apiserver but you are free to build your own in case you don't want to spawn random docker images
2. Create the `artifacts/example/webhookconfig.yaml`. This doesn't reference any real webhook but the failPolicy is set to ""Fail"", so no ""Flunders"" should be able to be created.
3. Create a flunder by running `kubectl create -f artifacts/flunders/01-flunder.yaml`

Without installing the admissioninstall packages in `pkg/apiserver/apiserver.go` (try to remove it), when we try to use ValidatingAdmissionWebhook, we get this error:

```
Error from server (InternalError): error when creating ""artifacts/flunders/01-flunder.yaml"": Internal error occurred: failed calling admission webhook ""warbles.k8s.io"": no kind is registered for the type v1beta1.AdmissionReview
```

After installing we get a better message:

```
Error from server (InternalError): error when creating ""artifacts/flunders/01-flunder.yaml"": Internal error occurred: failed calling admission webhook ""warbles.k8s.io"": Post https://192.168.64.1:8080/externalid: dial tcp 192.168.64.1:8080: getsockopt: connection refused
```

(This is the failPolicy taking effect)

This issue seems to be specific to the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook and the MutatingAdmissionWebhook. All other admission controllers probably work?

- i am guessing the answer is probably as simple as saying the same you would write any crd controleller with no aggregation, but just want to confirm.

once i have registered an apiservice to handle a custom resource, can i create a custom controller that watches the object using informers at the regular k8s apiserver, and expect everything to just work ?
