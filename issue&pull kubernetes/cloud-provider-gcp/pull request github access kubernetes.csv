The last commit is the most exciting.

To run the CCM:
```
$ bazel run //cmd/cloud-controller-manager:cloud-controller-manager-image
$ docker run gcr.io/k8s-image-staging/cloud-controller-manager:latest --help
```

To build the modified release tars:
```
$ bazel build //build:release-tars
```

It seems like #74 is attempting to overlay prebuilt release tars so I worked on mimicking that. Alternatively we could import the k/k build and rebuild the pieces that we need to produce our modified release.
