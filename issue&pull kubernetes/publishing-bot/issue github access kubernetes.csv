dep will warn the user when he chooses incompatible dependencies (so did @munnerz report, but with `dep init --gopath` I did not even get warnings, but it picked up master which it shouldn't).

publishing-bot,sttts,https://github.com/kubernetes/publishing-bot/issues/12,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/publishing-bot/issues/12,Version skew on tagging,"Our tagging algorithm is not 100% precise:

Assume we have the following commits in k/k (latest to earliest):

- commit **A** modifying `staging/src/k8s.io/api` only, tagged as `v1.9.0` in k/k
- commit **B** modifying `staging/src/k8s.io/client-go` only

The pubilshing bot cherry-picks these as:

- commit **A'** in `k8s.io/api`, tagged as `kubernetes-1.9.0` in `k8s.io/api`
- commit **B'** in `k8s.io/client-go`, tagged as `kubernetes-1.9.0` in `k8s.io/client-go 

The problem: Godeps/Godeps.json in k8s.io/client-go is generated assuming **B'** belongs to **B** in k/k. **B** maps to **A'^** in `k8s.io/api`. Hence, client-go's Godeps.json at **B'** points to **A'^** of `k8s.io/api`.

In [https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/releases/tag/v6.0.0](v6.0.0) this leads to one PR (kubernetes/kubernetes#57075) being missed from `k8s.io/api`, compare the following `k8s.io/api` release-1.9 branch screenshot. The hightlighted version appears in client-go's Godeps.json, while the `kubernetes-1.9.0` is one PR merge further up:

**For v6.0.0 this is not critical as this is only a documentation PR.** But we have to find a solution for this Godeps version skew soon and do a similar analysis before each new tag (and hope that no important PR is skipped).

    sha256 = ""4b14d8dd31c6dbaf3ff871adcd03f28c3274e42abc855cb8fb4d01233c0154dc"",

### Analysis

The [BUILD file](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/d902e7da4bfa28d901dca2cb81b76e40ee7703ae/kubernetes/typed/core/v1/BUILD) for the package `@io_k8s_client_go//kubernetes/typed/core/v1` refers to rules in `//vendor/k8s.io/...`. That directory doesn't exist in this repository.

I suspect this bot may have copied the source files from k/k without updating the build files. Not sure what the right answer is. If the bot removes build files during sync, it may be possible to regenerate them correctly with Gazelle via `go_repository`. If the bot updates build files using Gazelle during sync, all dependencies will need to be vendored or declared using external repositories in WORKSPACE.",closed,False,2018-02-28 18:07:52,2018-03-14 15:41:14

So default configuration values are followed. This leads to a dirty workspace.

To avoid this, we need to instruct git to not attempt any line ending conversions. The only way to override the config in `.gitattributes` files is through a `.git/info/attributes` file

This PR adds such a file and prevents any end-of-line conversions.

---

Ref: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

> When deciding what attributes are assigned to a path, Git consults $GIT_DIR/info/attributes file (which has the highest precedence), .gitattributes file in the same directory as the path in question, and its parent directories up to the toplevel of the work tree (the further the directory that contains .gitattributes is from the path in question, the lower its precedence). Finally global and system-wide files are considered (they have the lowest precedence).

---

I also double checked that this works in k/k:

1. Added `* text eol=lf` in `.gitattributes`.
2. `git add --renormalize .` and then `git status` shows a lot of files changed.
3. `echo ""* -text"" > .git/info/attributes` and then `git add --renormalize .` removes all those changes
4. `rm .git/info/attributes && git add --renormalize .` adds them back

(eg client-go depending on apiserver) and skips godeps generation for these

Note that we will still reset godeps for each commit (including the bad commit).
And the correct godep generation will take place once it encounters a good commit.

This is a temporary fix and should probably be reverted because it is not always
true that there will be a commit having the correct godep changes after a bad one
_immediately_. If there isn't a good commit after a bad one immediately, the commits
between them will have bad Godeps.json.

This gives us the flexibility to publish the cloud provider implementations developed in k8s.io/kubernetes into their respective external repos without forcing the entire repository to reflect what is in staging. 

An example of this would be to publish `k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/cloud-provider/gce` to `k8s.io/cloud-provider-gce/provider/`. This would keep only `k8s.io/cloud-provider-gce/provider/` in sync with what is staged but allow us to freely update any other directory in that repo. 

Happy to pick up any work required for this (will need some guidance though).
