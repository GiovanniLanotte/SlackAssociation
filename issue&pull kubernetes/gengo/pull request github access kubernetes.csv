This results in package imports like this: `pkgfoo ""k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/k8s.io/fake-dep/pkgfoo""`.

I attempted to handle this by rewriting the import just prior to serialization, but that doesn't handle cases where the package is used to inspect functions.  Because it doesn't rewrite the package path when its discovered, the package is wrong for any comparison against that package. In particular, this check here in conversion fails https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/libs/go2idl/conversion-gen/generators/conversion.go#L144, because it compares `k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/conversion.Scope` against `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/conversion.Scope`.

This patch will mis-identify a package that is actually called `vendor`, but it does correctly handle nesting at any level.  It does
 1.  `k8s.io/kubernetes/vendor/github.com/foo/bar` -> ` github.com/foo/bar`
 2. `k8s.io/contrib/some/vendor/github.com/foo/bar` -> ` github.com/foo/bar`
 3. `k8s.io/contrib/vendor/github.com/foo/bar` -> `github.com/foo/bar`

I think this is better than our current state today, we have no ""vendor"" package anywhere dep'ed in today and someone would have to be kind of crazy to make it.

One can specify the location input types with `types` key, the value will be the relative dir to where the types are defined (see https://github.com/caesarxuchao/kubernetes/commit/02ea1c78c4cf36f430fed204d200f9389f80b764):

when generateFor gets called with `interface{}`

This relates to #138 

This PR lacks testing for this: I'll need some guidance around this please.

I currently see two ways to do this:

* factorize the code that handles the interface type and unit-test this function
* add another type of end-to-end test, this time making sure that `deepcopy-gen` fails. This one seems a bit brittle as the cause of failure would need to be checked for the test to be effective.
