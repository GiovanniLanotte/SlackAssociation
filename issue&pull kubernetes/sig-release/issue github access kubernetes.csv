Now it's a really painful process to have to ping various Googlers to push the packages manually

The proposed way of fixing this is by making a new GCS bucket that is set up as a deb/rpm repo.
It must maintain the structure of the current `apt.kubernetes.io` repo.

Then, in the release process, packages will be built and published by just pushing to GCS.

It's also a lot easier to manage ACLs with a GCS bucket compared to the Google-internal stuff we're currently depending on. (Where the source code/tools used are confidential)

For converting `.deb` packages to something pushable to GCS we can use https://github.com/spotify/debify
I don't know what's the best way to create a yum repo, but will look for something useful

This is a tracker to discuss extending some form of the milestone automation we have for [issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/release/issues.md) to apply to pull requests.

The milestone has a different meaning on issues and PRs during code freeze:
* For issues, it means, ""This is a release-blocking bug.""
* For PRs, it means, ""This code change is ok to make during freeze.""

Note that these criteria can be independent: A PR might be allowed during freeze if it's approved for the milestone, even if it has no issue (`/approve no-issue`). Also, a PR associated with an issue that's approved for the milestone is not necessarily making a code change that's permissible during freeze.

For this reason, I propose applying milestone automation separately to issues and PRs, without trying to cross-reference the milestone status of issues linked from PRs. SIGs will need to separately approve the problem (issue) and the particular solution (PR) for the milestone.

The automation for PRs will help us do things like remove everything but release-blockers (`priority/critical-urgent`) from the milestone upon entering code freeze.

Federation!,"This issue is to pick up some debate/pointers from folks with more experience in k8s and its maintenance about the probable release versioning that is ideal for projects which have been separated out into their own github repos with the intention of independent maintenance and release. 
As the project until now was maintained and released as part of k8s releases, there are 2 alternatives to use:
- Follow k8s versioning and its releases (1.9 onwards).
- Start with a new versioning considering this release as 1.0-alpha/beta.0 (or something else).

Both have some pros and cons and there is no clear precedent.
We have an example of [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go), which maintains its own versioning scheme and publishes a compatibility matrix (probably not a very good example as its only a library for clients). We also have an example of tools like kubeadm and kubectl (which probably are candidates which will be maintained externally) but haven't reached there yet and the code and binaries still map to k8s core. It makes lot of sense to follow some scheme which by version itself can provide enough info to the reader about its compatibility with any given k8s release.

I initiated a [brief doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTfe2EieZMXKbDO3879De6sBbg402wJGFivxSDAkMY4/edit?usp=sharing) a while ago to collect comments. This issue is an attempt to share that will a wider audience and/or to collect feedback/suggestions for the same here. Please point me in the right direction if this is not the place for this topic.

This was due to a [recent commit to the tooling which excluded a change to the branch at branch time](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/507) which provided the opportunity to then tag the branch at branch-point + 1.  

The immediate remedy here to set the master branch straight so it is 'git describe'ing correctly was to remove the (beta) tag from the commit.

Proposal 1:

- [x] Submit [a change to the release-1.10 branch ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59960)solely for the purposes of tagging
- [x] Tag the release-1.10 branch with v1.10.0-beta.0
- [x] Update anago to [make a change to the release branch at branch time](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/519) so it can be tagged

~~Proposal 2:~~

- [ ] Wait for the first branch fast-forward and tag v1.10-0-beta.0 at branch-point + 1
- [ ] Update anago to no longer add a new tag to the master at branch time
- [ ] Update branchff to take an option to manually to tag the master branch with the new tag after the ""last"" fast-forward is done. Humans required.  Fragile.  Scary.

- Before Upgrading
  - New Deprecations
  - Removed Deprecations
  - Alpha, Beta, Stable
- Other Notable Changes
  - New Stuff
  - Version Upgrades
  - Not Very Notable
- Bug Fixes
  - User Facing
  - General Fixes and Reliability

I think that there are a lot of items in here that could be removed (ie: most of the ""not very notable"" and ""general fixes and reliability"" sections). I also think that a lot of cool trends are also becoming apparent (`kubectl`, apiserver, CRDs, GCP & Azure, Windows, and more).

I also think that this document could benefit from some good copy editing to make it all read more consistently, but I wanted to see if we could delete some of the notes before doing that.

sig-release,jberkus,https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/148,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/148,Change Timing of Burndown Meetings,"Contributors, Release Team, SIG Leads:

Previously, burndown meetings have been at 10am PST/PDT every day they are held (MWF in Slush, then every weekday in freeze).  This timeslot has two problems:

1. On Thursdays, it conflicts with the Community Meeting right when the Release Lead needs to be mobilizing the community to close last-minute bugs.
2. 10am PDT is pretty late for folks in Europe/Asia.

The latter has been a real problem, resulting in a minority of SIG leads actually attending the burndown meetings.

However, I am also aware of the limitations of the schedules of Googlers who work in Mountain View, which makes meetings earlier in the day hard.  Given that important roles in each RT are generally filled by MTV googlers, simply switching to 8am PST/PDT meetings would cause a different group of people to drop out.  Also, for those of us who work on mixed US/Europe teams, that 8am timeslot is awefully crowded.

As such, I can think of 3 possible courses going forwards:

1. Ignore the issue and keep the burndown meetings at 10am
2. Move the meetings to 8am Pacific and ask the googlers to change their commutes when needed for burndown;
3. Alternate burndown meeting times so that we spread the inconvenience around;
4. Some other creative solution?

If you are a current or former release team member, a SIG lead, or a contributor with a feature in 1.11, please comment below on what timings would work best to ensure that you attend burndowns.f

After a conversation with @justaugustus , he asked me to open an issue here to try to capture some of the things that seem fairly actionable.

/assign @justaugustus 

1.  All the frozen rows on the top of the spreadsheet add little value and make the spreadsheet hard to use on any screen that is not huge. I can only see 3-4 actual data rows on my 13"" MBP. Maybe this stuff can be put in a Metadata sheet instead, so people could click there to get the info but it is not persistent in the main view.

2.  We enumerate how many features are alpha, beta, and GA. It would be nice if there was a query that also pulled those rows out into one sheet per stage. Docs expectations (and probably testing expectations) are different for each of those stages, so it would be good to have a way to see, for instance, all the GA features.

3.  Speaking of alpha, beta, and GA, we are missing a piece of data that I think is important here too. I think it is important to know what stage a feature is moving FROM and what stage it is moving TO. I think right now we only capture what stage the feature will be in at GA. It's hard to see what features are truly new and what ones are moving to a higher level of maturity. I could imagine instances where we have things that start out at beta or GA, and things that start at alpha and then move straight to Deprecated, etc. If something is moving from Alpha to Beta, there may be some existing docs that just need to be updated. If it is a brand new feature though, it probably has zero docs.

4.  The links in the first column are confusing in two ways:
    - It is very hard to see the PR number or repo they are in, without actually clicking the link (the link text is obscured even on click / hover, because the links are so much longer than the column width of the sheet).
    - The links seem to usually go to the feature spec PR and not to the actual code PR(s). Yet it is the code PR owners who write the draft docs PRs and they reference the code PRs from the docs PRs. So with the info in the sheet now, it is really hard to map a docs PR to the relevant line item in this spreadsheet.

5.  If you mark a row as Docs Needed: Yes (or no) I do not see any way to turn it back into an unset value.

6.  It is unclear whose responsibility it is to update the ""Docs Needed"" and ""Docs PR"" fields. Whose job is it to determine if docs are needed for a given feature? Is it Docs or the feature owner? It makes sense that it would be the feature owner, since they are the ones who (to my understanding) submit the initial docs PR.

I think these are the things we talked about that are easily actionable. Please let me know if I missed anything.",closed,False,2018-05-22 22:45:37,2018-06-02 03:58:04

Shifts in 1.11 timeline especially around code slush and freeze are carrying forward into 1.12.  This is now the schedule intent, but if CI signal is not green as we get toward the intended sluch and freeze we may need to elongate them by starting them earlier.  This would be communicated early and broadly if it is an incoming risk to the release stability mid-cycle.

During the feature definition phase we will re-emphasize past intent to have initial docs drafts as well as test cases arriving in conjunction with the code at or ahead of code freeze.

In the final days of the cycle we lack the time (twelve week cycle versus desire for shorter freeze versus wanting freeze as late as possible) to dedicate more time for CI signal from long running tests during the ""thaw"" period when cherry picks from master present instability risk.

I would like to just continuously re-render these notes until it comes time to give them to the individual SIGs as the release burns down. So if there are any edits that we'd like to structurally incorporate into this document, let's encode it in the code so that we can keep re-applying the same patterns for notes sorting (if possible).

For each note, we have the following information available to use for document organization decision making:

- The note text itself
- All the commit info (SHA, author, etc)
- Labels on the PR (`kind/bug`, `release-note-action-required`, `sig-node`, etc)
- The PR description and comments

Right now, I'm using all the SIG labels I can find to pre-sort and then using the `kind/bug` and `release-note-action-required` label to add the ""Bug Fixes"" and ""Action Required"" sections respectively. Everything that doesn't have a SIG label or one of those two labels goes into ""Other Notable Changes"".

- [ ] Draft license audit policies for SIG Release
- [ ] File issues / PRs with [sub]projects to fix their licensing issues (list from @swinslow):
    - [ ] (@nikhita) The component github.com/heketi/heketi is used in four repos. Heketi uses a mix of licenses, but the main issue is that files in heketi/pkg/utils/ can only be used under LGPL-3.0 or GPL-2.0, both of which are likely problematic here. Can the files in heketi/pkg/utils/ be removed, or replaced with an alternative library under a more permissive license?
The repos are: ~kubernetes~ (fixed in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70811), minikube, autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler, and contrib/rescheduler
    - [ ] (@BenTheElder (test-infra) / @justinsb (kops)) There are GPL-2.0 LICENSE text files in the github.com/docker/docker component, within the contrib/selinux-* subfolders in four repos. There is no corresponding code in these directories. Can these directories and LICENSE files be removed?
The repos are: cloud-provider-aws, federation, ~kops~ (fixed in https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/6019), and ~test-infra~ (fixed in kubernetes/test-infra#8979)
    - [ ] (@justaugustus) The component github.com/juju/ratelimit is under LGPL-3.0 with a linking exception. It was replaced in the main kubernetes repo in #38320 to use golang.org/x/time/rate instead. juju/ratelimit is still present in several other kubernetes repos; can these be similarly updated to the alternate library?
The repos are: autoscaler/addon-resizer, contrib (in diurnal, docker-micro-benchmark, election, keepalived-vip, scale-demo and service-loadbalancer), dashboard, dns, federation, frakti, heapster, kompose, kube-deploy, node-problem-detector, perf-tests, and test-infra.
    - [ ] (@justaugustus) The component gopkg.in/yaml.v2 used to have the same LGPL-3.0 license, but has now been updated in the kubernetes repo to a newer version with Apache-2.0. Several other repos still use the old version under LGPL-3.0; can these also be updated?
The repos are: autoscaler/addon-resizer, contrib (in diurnal, docker-micro-benchmark, election, keepalived-vip, podex, scale-demo and service-loadbalancer), dashboard, federation, heapster, kube-deploy, node-problem-detector, perf-tests, publishing-bot and test-infra.
    - [ ] In minikube, there is a config file which states that it is part of systemd and is under LGPL-2.1. Most of the file is commented out. Is it necessary to distribute this file, or could it be obtained by the downstream user separately (along with systemd, which I assume we aren't distributing)?
    - [ ] In kops, /hooks/nvidia-bootstrap/README.md says that ""Using this hook indicates that you agree to"" a non-OSS license from NVIDIA. Is this intended to refer to software separately installed by the Dockerfile, rather than code in the kops repo itself? If so, I may propose a tweak to the language here.
    - [ ] (@nikhita) In the translations/ folder in kubernetes, there are 12 files stating that ""This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package."" (e.g., here) Can these be corrected to refer to Kubernetes specifically? - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66233
    - [x] (@nikhita) In the kubernetes-client javascript repo, a package.json file was added stating that the kubernetes-client-typescript package is under the Unlicense. Can this be corrected to Apache-2.0? - https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript/pull/61
- [ ] Close out [`k/steering` issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/57)

I populated aliases based on 1.7 forward.

I would have used a regex-based OWNERS file, but that doesn't cooperate with the `approve` plugin right now (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/7690) so I had to breakup into dirs per role.

- k8s-dev : master
- k8s-beta : release-1.11
- k8s-stable1 : release-1.10
- k8s-stable2 : release-1.9
- k8s-stable3 : release-1.8

When we create the release-1.12 branch, this mapping will become:
- k8s-dev : master
- k8s-beta : release-1.12
- k8s-stable1 : release-1.11
- k8s-stable2 : release-1.10
- k8s-stable3 : release-1.9

At which point the release-1.8 jobs will go away.  This means we will drop CI coverage of a release we now consider unsupported up to 6 weeks into the 1.12 release cycle.

How long have we waited in the past?
- release-1.7 jobs went away apr 13 (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/7459) or about 2 weeks into the 1.11 release cycle
- release-1.6 jobs went away jan 30 (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/6538) or about 5 weeks into the 1.10 release cycle
- release-1.5 jobs went away oct 30 (https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/4862) or about 4 weeks into the 1.9 release cycle

In that light, 6 weeks seems like a pretty conservative waiting period.

sig-release,AishSundar,https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/294,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/294,Release 1.13 timeline and schedule,"Here's a straw-man PR for the 1.13 release schedule. In general the timeline across the calendar quarter for this release is highly crunched due to 2 Kubecons (Shangai, Nov 13-15 and Seattle, Dec 11-13), US Thanksgiving (Nov, 22-23) and the holiday season during last 2 weeks of December.  

I have highlighted some main points below in an attempt to explain my rationale around the schedule and welcome any input/feedback:

* The release cycle length is only **10 weeks** long (reasons stated above).
*  Total feature planning and development time are reduced by a week each (both are in keeping with release 1.9, which was also a shorter cycle).
    * Start of release cycle to Feature freeze is **3 weeks** vs traditional 4 weeks.
    * Time between Feature freeze and Code freeze is **3.5 weeks** vs traditional 4.5 weeks.
* Code slush and Code freeze will continue to follow a shortened timeframe, of 1 week and 2 weeks respectively, in keeping with 1.11 and 1.12 cycles. But if CI signal is not green as we get toward the intended slush and freeze we may need to elongate them by starting them earlier. This would be communicated early and broadly if it is an incoming risk to the release stability mid-cycle.
* Code thaw is **only 3 days long**! This is mainly to get the release out before Kubecon Seattle which falls in the 2nd week of December. Releasing post Kubecon (3rd week of December) will be risky due to contributors' potential unavailability and is also the least preferred option in terms of media attention and PR. Hence, aiming for a release in the 1st week of December will still give us some wiggle room to release during Kubecon in the event of possible slip.  

With all that said, **feature load and planning by SIGs will play the most crucial factor in keeping this release on track**. Delivering features on time **with quality** will help stabilize CI signal faster and release on time. During the feature definition phase we will meet with SIGs to re-emphasize release cycle length and encourage them to gauge and plan their feature aspirations accordingly. We carry on the past intent to have initial docs drafts as well as test cases arriving in conjunction with the code at or ahead of code freeze.

In the final days of the cycle in an attempt to thaw and stabilize the release sooner we may postpone more incoming cherry picks to the point release depending on risk assessments.",closed,True,2018-09-14 03:53:58,2018-09-26 15:55:15

## Membership Management
**Legacy group confusion**
Problem: kubernetes-security@googlegroup and security@kubernetes exist for legacy reasons and is confusing when adding folks

Delete kubernetes-security@googlegroups.com, prefer security@kubernetes.io going forward

- [x] Update docs https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/328 and https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/10516
- [x] Send deprecation notice for October 31st
- [x] Unsubscribe everyone and turn off posting DO NOT DELETE

**Delegate release manager subscription management**

Problem: every 3 months new release managers come on board. We missed adding the 1.12 release managers until a few weeks ago for example :(
Solution: Delegate responsibility to update this to the previous release managers.

Actions:
- [x] Create security-release-team@kubernetes.io with the current active release managers
- [x] Give ownership of this group to release managers to self-govern as release managers change
- [x] Subscribe security-release-team@ to security@kubernetes.io 
- [x] Remove non PST members from direct subscription to security@kubernetes.io

NOTE: this can’t be done on googlegroups.com because of the no nesting rules on the non-Gsuite groups

**Move kubernetes-distributors-announce to kubernetes.io**

Problem: manual maintenance of PST and release manager subscriptions on that list :( :( :( 

- [x] Create distributors-annouce@kubernetes.io
- [x] Migrate membership
- [x] Announce deprecation notice for October 31st
- [x] Shut off posting to kubernetes-distributors-announce@googlegroups.com

## Introduce Public and Private Discussion Lists
Problem: meta discussion about the security processes happen on the security@kubernetes.io list making it difficult to triage issues
Solution: create public and private meta discussion lists

Actions:
- [x] Create kubernetes-security-discuss@googlegroups.com which anyone can subscribe to and subscribe the current set of folks
- [x] Create security-discuss-private@kubernetes.io for private non disclosure discussion (PST membership additions, review of proposals like distributor subscription requests, etc)",closed,False,2018-10-05 00:34:50,2019-01-14 18:24:53

In practice this hasn’t happened because there is no automation around a rotation so no one is rotating.

To fix this Brandon will setup a weekly Pager Duty rotation for all PST members. This rotation will enable PST members to get an email, push notification, or SMS based on new security@kubernetes.io threads.

Further, to help the project manager assign roles we should create a helper tool that watches the PagerDuty API and if the incident is “Acknowledged” a GitHub issue, on a private repo, will be automatically created with a template to help the project manager assign other roles and organize the response.

Initial tool: https://github.com/philips/oncall-issue-filer

Todo List
- [x] Get on-call tool https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/72

- In v1.12, towards the end we did not have proper tags in the repositories published by publish bot from staging/ as we ran into different issues. So to exercise the tools earlier in the cycle, both both and release tooling will be helpful for the patch branch manager and shadows as well the folks manning the bots.
- Different teams (for example https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage) depend on the tags we publish, so more times we cut the tag, the easier it will be for folks to keep up with master and keep things up-to-date. (Example i am dealing with right now is that pkg/util/version moved into apimachinery and if we don't cut an extra alpha, it will be 2 weeks before any consumers can sync with the changes going on in k/k master)

I don't know if the alpha.1 has any other connotation/meaning in the larger scheme of the release process. Hope i have made my case :)

This results in delays leading up to release, contributes to the reputation of .0 releases being beta-quality at best, and allows regressions to slip through the cracks in patch releases.

- take the gke jobs off of release-blocking boards
- make a release-master-informing board and migrate jobs to it
- update ci signal docs accordingly
- hunt down job owners and update job descriptions
- propose and implement the use of sig-foo-alerts googlegroups for testgrid alerts
- implement a velodrome dashboard that shows how well release blocking jobs are
  meeting these criteria

- assignment of owners to all jobs
- descriptions added to all release-master-blocking jobs
- propose the creation of sig-foo-alerts@googlegroups.com or reuse of sig-foo-test-failures for all sigs that need to be responsive to test failures
- the creation of the release-informing dashboard, and moving jobs out of release-master-blocking to that dashboard
- a bigquery run that generates metrics for jobs currently on the release-master-blocking dashboard

sig-release,jberkus,https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/368,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/368,Proposal: selection process for Shadows,"**The Problem:**

RT Section Lead/Shadow is a mentorship relationship, but we have not been treating it as one.  Instead of having a process to select the most suitable mentees for a given cycle, we simply accept anyone who volunteers before a certain deadline, up to four shadows per lead.  This has resulted in leads having too many shadows for them to manage, and shadows not being mentored for the role they are shadowing.  Further, we have contributors volunteering to shadow without any clear idea of what they're committing to or what the requirements and expectations are.

**The Proposal:**

We should have a semi-formal selection process, which should work as follows:

1. shadow applicant applies for their shadow position using a specific questionnaire for the shadow role.  A draft template for these questionnaires follows.
2. the section lead and the RT Lead (or shadow) review the questionnaires and pick the candidates with the necessary time availability and other requirements for the role.
3. the section lead and the RT Lead have a brief chat with each qualified candidate (by slack, video, or other convenient mechanism) to select for mentorship match.
4. The section lead and RT lead pick the final Shadows for that RT.

As a prerequisite to this, it would also be good to establish guidelines on how many shadows are the maximum practical for a given role.  For example, CI signal can't really make use of more than 2 shadows, but Docs is capable of keeping up to 4 shadows busy.

This also begs the question of whether we should have a process for selecting section leads.  To date, one hasn't seemed necessary because, unlike shadows, we have a shortage rather than a surplus of volunteers, and generally all section leads are well-known from prior release teams.

## draft template for shadow questionnaire

You have asked to be a _role_ Shadow for the _ver_ Release Team. This questionnaire is to determine how well you match the position's requirements, and to give you an idea what's involved.  In cases where there are too many applicants for a particular role, it may also be used to decide who is selected this release cycle.  Please note that you are expected to be inexperienced in some areas, as Shadow is a mentored role.

1. The _role_ handbook [link] defines the tasks and responsibilities of the role for this release cycle.  Are you prepared to assist in fulfilling these duties?  Please read the full handbook before answering.
 
2. _role_ Shadow requires a substantial time commitment, especially
during _busy_period_ (_dates_). This can be more than _time requirement_, and may include attending video meetings at inconvenient times.  Is this time you can commit to?

*Example: Issues/PR Triage requires a substantial time commitment, especially during the 2nd half of the release cycle (Nov. 5 to Dec. 5). This can be more than an hour a day, and may include attending video meetings at inconvenient times. Is this time you can commit to?*

(optional)
2.a. _role_ Shadow also requires _additional requirement_.  Is this something you are comfortable with?

*Example: Release Notes Shadow also requires editing and rewriting release notes, in English, to make them clearer and more accurate.  Is this something you are comfortable with?*

3. Do you have any schedule conflicts during this release cycle (_dates_), such as vacations, school, or intense periods of work, that would make you unavailable for more than a couple of workdays?

4. The purpose of shadowing is to train new Release Team members.
Assuming that your job or life situations don't change between now and
then, are you willing to volunteer for the _role_ Lead for _ver+1_ or
_ver+2_?  This usually requires support from your employer, as you will
probably need to do release work during work hours.

5. What's your current experience and involvement with _related_SIG_if_any_ and _area_of_expertise_?

*Example: What's your current experience and involvement with SIG-Testing, and automated tests in general?*

6. Are you already a Kubernetes Org member?

7. Have you applied to, or served on, a prior release team?  Please give details.

8. What time zone are you usually in?

9. Any comments on what interested you in this role and the release team?",closed,False,2018-11-14 03:13:59,2019-01-10 00:02:14

These would be the general criteria:

**blocking:** jobs that must pass for a release to take place, and [meet all of the blocking criteria](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/346) for reliability, ownership, and frequency.

**informing**: jobs that often supply useful information about breakage in the release, but fail to meet one of the criteria for reliability, ownership, or frequency.  Examples: all of the current upgrade/downgrade jobs (too flaky), gce-scale-correctness (too infrequent).

**extra**: test jobs whose signal-to-noise ratio it too low for them to be informing, or are too narrow to be blocking, but sometimes are useful to look at for specific things.  Examples: GKE jobs, non-parallel upgrade jobs (if we have any left), maybe some of the conformance jobs.

Note that I've dropped *all* above.  This is because, as CI Signal for 1.13, I found the all board hard to read due to the sheer number of tests on it.  I'd rather have three smaller, exclusive, groups.

So, some spec questions before I start trying to make lists of which jobs belong in which group for approval:

1. Do people agree with the basic division of blocking/informing/extra?

2. Do people agree that ""all"" is not useful if the tests on it are represented in other groups?

3. Should we have the mature conformance tests on one of these groups?  If so, in informing or extra?

4. Should we even have an ""extra"" group, given that we might never look at it?

Previous release leads and patch release managers have found that there's not a lot of clear documentation or well understood ""case law"" to facilitate decisions on whether a given change justifies the risk of letting it land.  We use `priority/critical-urgent` which has a description, but in reality different people seem to interpret the label in different ways, and each decision comes down to a negotiated one-off.

Perhaps its use is vestigial.  We used it as an additional piece of friction to differentiate from Code Slush, where being in the milestone was good enough.  Humans really like using priority labels during the burndown to do a quick bucket/sort of PR's remaining.  But is there value in having the bots pay attention to the same label?

I propose we find out by dropping the requirement, with the right to arbitrarily bring the requirement back in if we find that Code Freeze is not accomplishing the goal of making the release more stable.

sig-release,d-nishi,https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/486,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/486,Soliciting feedback: Release cadence for out-of-tree features,"SIGs such as the cloud providers operate like user-groups. The SIGs are responsible for tight integrations of provider APIs with Kubernetes APIs/Interfaces such as out-of-tree cloud provider interfaces, CSI, CNI, CRI specifications etc. These integrations satisfy a Kubernetes user's needs when running Kubernetes on a cloud provider (not necessarily motivated to enhance a specific implementation of Kubernetes such as EKS or AKS or GKE or VKE). These integrations contribute to the richness of the Kubernetes ecosystem and aim to drive consistent behavior through the interface implementation across providers. It is therefore in the best interest of the Kubernetes user that such implementations/integrations be pegged to a Kubernetes major version release and the testing, documentation discipline enforced on the in-tree Kubernetes features be adopted/recommended for the out-of-tree feature releases as well.

This leads to a couple of open questions that need to be resolved/discussed since no reference able guidelines exists today. Referring specifically to this [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/386) in v1.13

1. Tracking out-of-tree Kubernetes features - should this be out of scope for the SIG-release team and in scope for the responsible SIG?

2. Cadence of out-of-tree feature releases - should SIGs continue to adhere to release best practices that Kubernetes in-tree features follow aka follow the requirements necessary with testing and documentation to move the feature from alpha to beta to GA?

3. Reporting out-of-tree feature updates - should a summary for out-of-tree features continue to be added to the Major Theme section of the release notes as described [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.13/release-notes-draft.md)

4. Publishing test results in testgrid - should the integration test results be post-submit, non-blocking and be visible in testgrid for an out-of-tree feature to qualify as beta/GA?

5. Documentation - should the documentation be regularly updated for a feature to move through the release cadence?

6. KEPs - should KEPs be necessarily updated for a feature to move through the release cadence?

7. Release cadence ownership - should the SIG Chairs be responsible for the quality of the releases and the systematic follow through on the release cadence?",open,False,2019-02-01 00:04:39,2019-02-17 08:28:20

the family of tests kubadm-gce*:
https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-cluster-lifecycle-all

are a based on a deprecated and unmaintained project called kubernetes-anywhere:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-anywhere/

to be able to test such deployments we are using a deployer in test-infra called `kubernetes-anywhere`
https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/kubetest/anywhere.go

**request:**

remove the following tests from release-blocking dashboards:
- kubeadm-gce-master (or a release branch)
- kubeadm-gce-x-on-y (where x and y are k releases)

replace with:
- kubeadm-kind-* (master is done, 1.xx branch tests are to be fixed early next week, hopefully)
- periodic-packages-install-deb

**rationale:**

- we are testing production grade code using a deprecated deployer!
- the kubeadm conformance coverage is already done by using kind as a deployer:
https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-cluster-lifecycle-all#kubeadm-kind-master
- the kubadm package installation is done using a separate package test:
https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-cluster-lifecycle-all#periodic-packages-install-deb
- due to changes in the e2e testing framework we are now unable to obtain logs from the GCE nodes.
this means we cannot debug properly the test jobs. there might be a solution for that, but after a number of PRs i gave up.
- kubernetes-anywhere is not reproducible locally! it's a strange beast and works locally only when it wants to (weird SSH failures).

we don't have a replacement for `kubeadm-gce-x-on-y` yet but it will come in the 1.15 cycle.

**stakeholders:**

i'm going to add some developers here that have witnessed the horrors of kubernetes-anywhere lately:

I've added the same deletion time as the developer guide in k/community (https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3196) so that we can nuke everything at once. :)

Rationale behind choose 1 July 2019 or v1.15 (whichever is sooner):
v1.14 gets released on 25 March. The next release (1.15) is usually after three months so that would be late June or early July. July also gives us enough time to cleanup any links if needed.

sig-release,neolit123,https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/539,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/539,considerations about enhancement tracking,"## introduction

each release, before feature freeze, the release team enhancement sub-team has the task to verify the status of pending features to be merged in k/kubernetes.

the team uses a google docs [spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/116X6E-lmDJG5UZPlqDAFw8hN9vS6SNY4qRNZ9fKtsMU/edit#gid=0) that includes a lot of details like pending PRs, SIG owners, feature state and even some statistics.

each feature has a tracking issue located in the [kuberenetes/enhancements (k/e)](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues) repository and after a recent change all features must also have a KEP, also located in the [same repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps).

## problem statements

while attempting to obtain information about the current state-of-implementation of a certain feature, the release team has to post messages in k/e tracking issues, asking owners and maintainers:

### what pending external to k/e tracking issues are there?

this topic is noisy because there is no standardization. every SIG uses a different schema for tracking their work. some use separate repositories, some use multiple issues for each item, some use a single tracking issue for each item.

#### proposal

the [issue template](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) has to be updated to include a list of tracking issues (or a single umbrella tracking issue). a list of tracking issues should look like this:

```
state: Alpha
target: 1.14
description of item1
- [ ] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [ ] TODO
```

`description of itemX` must match with an item in the KEP.
`kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567` is a tracking issue of an item.
`- [ ]` is a checkbox that indicates completion.

### what PRs are merged and what are yet to be created?

often times this question is hard to answer. multiple PR can accumulate over the course of the cycle for the exact same feature or work items. this can be very noisy and difficult to track by the release team.

#### proposal

PRs should not be an indication if a feature is ""ready"" for this release. tracking issues should be. the maintainer of the k/e main tracking issues should add checkmarks and links to the features that are completed. an external tracking issue and its PRs should cross reference. once all PRs are in the external tracking issue should be closed.

```
state: Alpha
target: 1.14
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#7654321
```

### do you have documentation and test coverage?

arguable the hardest items to complete for a feature...

#### proposal

the proposal here is fairly simple. just extend the list to add tracking items for tests and documentation:


```
state: Beta
target: 1.15
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#7654321
documentation:
- [ ] kubernetes/website#12345
tests:
- [ ] kubernetes/test-infra#12345
```

note that an Alpha state might not require a testing plan or documentation.
also that `website` and `test-infra` are just example locations. repos for tracking issues are matter of preference.

### is this feature going to ""make it"" this release?

a vague question for both sides, as those who are asking might not know what the feature does, while those who are questioned might not know if they can complete in time.

the feature lifecycle is undefined (or probably defined in a hard to find document).
if one googles ""kubernetes feature lifecycle alpha beta ga"" it gives them this link:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

#### proposal

the issue template from k/e should link to such a lifecycle document.

if such a document does not provide the following information, it should:
- Alpha means experimental feature, that does not require documentation, while tests are nice to have.
- Beta means that a feature should have tests and documentation in place and be ready for consumption.
- GA means that all important bugs from beta are fixed, tests and documentation are updated and the feature is ready for general availability.

```
state: GA
target: 1.16
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#7654321
documentation:
- [x] kubernetes/website#12345
tests:
- [x] kubernetes/test-infra#12345
```

at this point, if a release team member sees the above list, verifies that all items are indeed closed and completed, there would be no need to ask questions even

### examples of implementation lifecycles of a feature

```
state: Alpha
target: 1.14
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567

state: Beta
target: 1.15
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567

- [x] kubernetes/test-infra#12345

state: GA
target: 1.16
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#7654321
documentation:
- [x] kubernetes/website#12345
tests:
- [x] kubernetes/test-infra#12345
```

```
state: Alpha
target: 1.14
description of item1
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567
description of item2
- [x] kubernetes/kubernetes#1234567

state: Beta
target: TODO

state: GA
target: TODO
```

### other considerations:

#### handling subprojects

subprojects should not be treated in a special way (e.g. see ""kubeadm"" [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/release-team-lead#week-3) and [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/release-team-lead#week-6)).

all features that land in k/k should follow a standardized way of organization of the tracked issues.
links from k/e tracking issues could link to any GitHub issue.

#### project boards (alternative approach)

while SIGs such as Windows and API-Machinery are already using project boards for tracking their own work, they can be tricky with regards to:
- permissions (who can edit?).
- organization of tabs, searching for labels, grouping of issues.
- they collide with milestones.
- AFAIK they do not have edit history.

while i definitely see the potential of using them, i went with the alternative approach of linking individual tracking issues. this approach is more linear and easy to follow by the release team, but requires more from the SIGs.

if SIG Release prefers project boards, we can go with this idea and link k/e tickets to project boards, but this requires some extra planning.

#### a problem with permissions

for both approaches, there is a problem with permissions. currently, only milestone maintainers can edit the k/e tickets (some of these rot with outdated information). while project boards also require a specific team to be able to edit. project boards win here in terms of flexibility, but again lack the linearity of the implementation timeline and edit history.

ideally the list of k/e ticket maintainers should be extended outside of milestone maintainers. milestone maintainers have the power to apply milestone in k/k while here we can have a separate group e.g. feature maintainers, which is a limited scope.

#### auto-pings vs human contact

often times developers are busy and/or they forget. so while we can continue to ping them in k/e tickets and slack, the general reminders can be automated in the lines of ""hey, feature freeze is soon. please edit the OP of this document to include relevant items and/or update the status"". if there is no follow up update after the automated message, human contact can follow on slack.

as SIG scalability chairs

This was a thing SIG Scalability used to do. (ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/processes/scalability-validation.md#scalability-validation-of-the-release)

They created reports for [1.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/bb29a69716201a4e461e719ea7c78ad277cc0fb4/releases/release-1.8/scalability_validation_report.md), and [1.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/bb29a69716201a4e461e719ea7c78ad277cc0fb4/releases/release-1.9/scalability_validation_report.md).  Then I couldn't find any more.

I was reminded of this as I noticed the `[DisabledForLargeClusters]` tag that is used by some tests.  If I were an end user, how would I know which behaviors are and are not expected to work at scale?  My answer to this used to be the scalability validation report.  Let's try bringing it back (though I won't block the release if this can't get done in time, given that we haven't blocked a release on this in over a year)

> Make sure the issue is assigned against the current milestone 1.x, using /milestone

but it doesn't specifically add any guidelines about how to assign a milestone to an issue.

As mentioned in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/74960#issuecomment-471623904, the milestone can be used for discovery of for completion:

> - for discovery purposes; makes sense, this work is very relevant to 1.14, and includes issue that are targetted for this release.
> - for completion purposes; there's a good chance that this umbrella issue won't be ""finished"" by 1.14, and will likely be relevant to future releases. I think that's still ok - did you think the same @spiffxp ?

Leaving us with the question of whether all issues pertaining to release X should be tracked by milestone X or should milestone maintainers keep only issues that will be worked on for the given release? And if an issue is removed from the current release, should a milestone maintainer/CI signal team member marked the issue for the next release?

sig-release,lachie83,https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/571,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/571,Proposal: shadow halo process,"In an effort to build a pool of capable community members to serve on the release team and to ensure succession, the shadow role was created and implemented many release cycles ago. It occurred to me that there is no clear path for shadows to NOT serve on consistent release cycles and still be eligible for a lead role and hence I would like to discuss an idea that I refer to as ""shadow haloing"". 

The purpose of shadow haloing is to provide a capable contingent of shadow members that are eligible to serve lead roles without the burden of having to commit consistently to contiguous release processes. This may also aide in easing burnout by having already served as a shadow but not been given the opportunity to serve as a lead.

The initial details are as follows:
* An existing shadow is eligible to serve in a lead role so long as they have served on a release team in any role within the last three releases.

I am reluctant to put too much process in this issue without having discussed the high level concept for now. The process can be as simple as proving eligibility and submitting interest in serving a role on a specific release team and providing sufficient verbiage around this being a valid path.
