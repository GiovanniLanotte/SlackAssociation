I copied the changelog from v1.10.0 to to 3dbcd1d (current master while I was working on this (April 25)). The notes in this doc so far are categorized into the following hierarchy:

- Before Upgrading
  - New Deprecations
  - Removed Deprecations
  - Alpha, Beta, Stable
- Other Notable Changes
  - New Stuff
  - Version Upgrades
  - Not Very Notable
- Bug Fixes
  - User Facing
  - General Fixes and Reliability

I think that there are a lot of items in here that could be removed (ie: most of the ""not very notable"" and ""general fixes and reliability"" sections). I also think that a lot of cool trends are also becoming apparent (`kubectl`, apiserver, CRDs, GCP & Azure, Windows, and more).

I also think that this document could benefit from some good copy editing to make it all read more consistently, but I wanted to see if we could delete some of the notes before doing that.

Shifts in 1.11 timeline especially around code slush and freeze are carrying forward into 1.12.  This is now the schedule intent, but if CI signal is not green as we get toward the intended sluch and freeze we may need to elongate them by starting them earlier.  This would be communicated early and broadly if it is an incoming risk to the release stability mid-cycle.

During the feature definition phase we will re-emphasize past intent to have initial docs drafts as well as test cases arriving in conjunction with the code at or ahead of code freeze.

In the final days of the cycle we lack the time (twelve week cycle versus desire for shorter freeze versus wanting freeze as late as possible) to dedicate more time for CI signal from long running tests during the ""thaw"" period when cherry picks from master present instability risk.  We may postponing more incoming cherry picks to the point release depending on risk assessments.","['justaugustus', 'AishSundar']",1,2018-06-16 02:02:48,2018-07-03 18:49:21,2018-07-03 18:49:21,True,2018-07-03 18:49:21,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

I would like to just continuously re-render these notes until it comes time to give them to the individual SIGs as the release burns down. So if there are any edits that we'd like to structurally incorporate into this document, let's encode it in the code so that we can keep re-applying the same patterns for notes sorting (if possible).

For each note, we have the following information available to use for document organization decision making:

- The note text itself
- All the commit info (SHA, author, etc)
- Labels on the PR (`kind/bug`, `release-note-action-required`, `sig-node`, etc)
- The PR description and comments

Right now, I'm using all the SIG labels I can find to pre-sort and then using the `kind/bug` and `release-note-action-required` label to add the ""Bug Fixes"" and ""Action Required"" sections respectively. Everything that doesn't have a SIG label or one of those two labels goes into ""Other Notable Changes"".

That leaves the second alpha (alpha.1) as the first point where the
current release team builds an alpha release and the new release branch
manager gets to work out any process and permissions kinks.

Looking back it appears there's been legacy copy/pasted info implying
the first alpha was .1 and happened in week 2, but that hasn't been the

In general the timeline across the calendar quarter for this release is highly crunched due to 2 Kubecons (Shangai, Nov 13-15 and Seattle, Dec 11-13), US Thanksgiving (Nov, 22-23) and the holiday season during last 2 weeks of December.  

I have highlighted some main points below in an attempt to explain my rationale around the schedule and welcome any input/feedback:

* The release cycle length is only **10 weeks** long (reasons stated above).
*  Total feature planning and development time are reduced by a week each (both are in keeping with release 1.9, which was also a shorter cycle).
    * Start of release cycle to Feature freeze is **3 weeks** vs traditional 4 weeks.
    * Time between Feature freeze and Code freeze is **3.5 weeks** vs traditional 4.5 weeks.
* Code slush and Code freeze will continue to follow a shortened timeframe, of 1 week and 2 weeks respectively, in keeping with 1.11 and 1.12 cycles. But if CI signal is not green as we get toward the intended slush and freeze we may need to elongate them by starting them earlier. This would be communicated early and broadly if it is an incoming risk to the release stability mid-cycle.
* Code thaw is **only 3 days long**! This is mainly to get the release out before Kubecon Seattle which falls in the 2nd week of December. Releasing post Kubecon (3rd week of December) will be risky due to contributors' potential unavailability and is also the least preferred option in terms of media attention and PR. Hence, aiming for a release in the 1st week of December will still give us some wiggle room to release during Kubecon in the event of possible slip.  

With all that said, **feature load and planning by SIGs will play the most crucial factor in keeping this release on track**. Delivering features on time **with quality** will help stabilize CI signal faster and release on time. During the feature definition phase we will meet with SIGs to re-emphasize release cycle length and encourage them to gauge and plan their feature aspirations accordingly. We carry on the past intent to have initial docs drafts as well as test cases arriving in conjunction with the code at or ahead of code freeze.

In the final days of the cycle in an attempt to thaw and stabilize the release sooner we may postpone more incoming cherry picks to the point release depending on risk assessments.","['spiffxp', 'jberkus', 'jdumars', 'tpepper']",1,2018-09-14 03:53:58,2018-09-26 15:55:15,2018-09-26 15:55:15,True,2018-09-26 15:55:15,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

- In v1.12, towards the end we did not have proper tags in the repositories published by publish bot from staging/ as we ran into different issues. So to exercise the tools earlier in the cycle, both both and release tooling will be helpful for the patch branch manager and shadows as well the folks manning the bots.
- Different teams (for example https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage) depend on the tags we publish, so more times we cut the tag, the easier it will be for folks to keep up with master and keep things up-to-date. (Example i am dealing with right now is that pkg/util/version moved into apimachinery and if we don't cut an extra alpha, it will be 2 weeks before any consumers can sync with the changes going on in k/k master)

I don't know if the alpha.1 has any other connotation/meaning in the larger scheme of the release process. Hope i have made my case :)

We, the release team, end up spending much of our time rationalizing and explaining away failing or flaky tests as red-but-green, or ignoring meaningful failures under the guise of perpetual-failure being the expected normal state. 

This results in delays leading up to release, contributes to the reputation of .0 releases being beta-quality at best, and allows regressions to slip through the cracks in patch releases.

This PR proposes release blocking job criteria based on https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/24 to help us eliminate noise and improve signal

The criteria spelled out here are less strict than the criteria in that issue but this is based on what the jobs look like today.

Once this PR lands I would like to move the release-blocking jobs toward the criteria listed, and refine as described in the TODO's. e.g.:

- take the gke jobs off of release-blocking boards
- make a release-master-informing board and migrate jobs to it
- update ci signal docs accordingly

Until we are able to pre-build and stage release artifacts for security releases, there is a gap of multiple hours between when fixes are pushed to public branches and when release artifacts for all release branches are available. Pre-announcing security-related changes will be landing during that time and drawing attention to the issues before fixed versions are available has consistently been deemed more harmful than helpful.

This PR updates this document to reflect the current security release process. As capability for private release build/staging is achieved, we can consider how to reintroduce public pre-release notification to the process.

The Product Security Committee has been created and the new docs exist at https://github.com/kubernetes/security. This PR adds tombstone files with redirects to new docs.

I've added the same deletion time as the developer guide in k/community (https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3196) so that we can nuke everything at once. :)

Rationale behind choose 1 July 2019 or v1.15 (whichever is sooner):
v1.14 gets released on 25 March. The next release (1.15) is usually after three months so that would be late June or early July. July also gives us enough time to cleanup any links if needed.
