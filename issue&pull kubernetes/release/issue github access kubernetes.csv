release,david-mcmahon,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/2,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/2,Improve pre-release reporting dashboard,"[relnotes](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/relnotes) has a mechanism for generating a release preview that is currently used internally at Google, but it would be great to expose this externally so the whole community can keep a regular eye on a release all along the way until it is cut.  The report provides the following:

- Preview of the release notes that will ship with a release
- Pending PRs on the branch (non-master only)
- State of the branch based on jenkins builders/testing

An example run looks like this:
```
$ relnotes --htmlize-md --branch=release-1.6 --preview --markdown-file=/tmp/k8s-release-1.6.md --html-file=/tmp/k8s-release-1.2.html
```
or
```
$ relnotes --htmlize-md --branch=master --preview --markdown-file=/tmp/k8s-master.md --html-file=/tmp/k8s-master.html
```

This issue will track this current list of wants:
- [ ] Expose this externally so that the community can see it
- [ ] Tailor the layout to make it more readable/parsable
- [ ] Based on testing state and the last good git hash that would be chosen for a release, cross out the release notes that would get missed if we released today(now).

The images don't need to be bundled directly with the Kubernetes release because they are just pulled from the registry.

Tools, however, typically can't be pulled in that way. However, we would like to make it easy for users to get popular tools. [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) is a prime candidate. It should be ready for bundling with K8s 1.4. [Kompose](https://github.com/skippbox/kompose) is another possibility.

For example, #27861 seems like a good release note for 1.3 but we don't want it as a relnote for 1.2.5 (since it was rolled back). 

The fix probably entails checking the cherry-pick for a release note state and letting it override the source PRs state and then updating the cherry-pick doc to allow for that in these special circumstances.    I can't immediately think of any issues with that approach.

It will mean more processing time and github polling to check labels for both PRs for every merge pull.

release,dgoodwin,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/50,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/50,WIP: Add kubelet RPM package builds.,"First attempt at the RPMs requested in issue #37. 

This is intended to be relatively self contained build process that can hopefully be integrated into the larger k8s release process, just drop into the
directory and run the build-docker.sh script to launch a Docker
container with appropriate rpm/yum tooling.

Resulting rpms and yum repository metadata will appear in output/
sub-directory and can then just be rsynced, after which client systems just need a simple yum repository file similar to this one I tested with (don't try to use it it's not publically accessible):

```
[root@centos1 ~]# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo 
[kubernetes]
name=K8s Repository
baseurl=http://file.rdu.redhat.com/~dgoodwin/kubernetes-rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

I took an alternate naming scheme from the Debian equivalent in #35 and packaged this as ""kubernetes"" rather than ""kubelet"", the reasoning behind this was that between hyperkube, an possible incoming rename to kube, self-hosting, and discussion around kube-master and kube-node etc, I don't know as the kubelet name will survive as the thing a user should be thinking to install. ""kubernetes"" however, should remain constant at least as a base package in all of this and wherever we end up. This also more closely matches the Fedora RPM packaging today which is further decomposed into the following packages: 

kubernetes.x86_64 : Container cluster management
kubernetes-client.x86_64 : Kubernetes client tools
kubernetes-node.x86_64 : Kubernetes services for node host
kubernetes-master.x86_64 : Kubernetes services for master host

release,errordeveloper,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/113,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/113,CNI cosmetics,"# Paths

We've had to put CNI bits in `/opt`, as there was no way to tell kubelet to look in other places. As of kubernetes/kubernetes#32151 (already in 1.4), we can pass `--cni-bin-dir=` as well as `--cni-conf-dir=` to kubelet. I makes sense to put the plugins into `/usr/lib/cni` or `/usr/lib/kubelet/cni/bin` or `/usr/libexec/cni` - anything other then `/opt` is good. The reason for this is that traditionally `/opt` is used for installing ad-hoc pieces, not for things installed by the package manager. We could also move `/etc/cni` to `/etc/kubernets/cni`, so we have everything in one directory.
# Package name

I seems like `kuberentes-cni` would be something user has to lookup, calling it `kubernetes-cni-basic-network-plugins` (or just `kubernetes-basic-network-plugins`) would make it more obvious. Word ""basic"" (or ""vanilla"" or ""generic"" or something similar) is also good, so we don't give user the impression that they'll have all the plugins.

release,david-mcmahon,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/114,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/114,Dynamic disk space check for anago,"Right now the anago release tool has a disk check in it to make sure we have enough disk to do a full release build, but it's static and the state of Kubernetes (and how big it is) is wildly in flux 

I'd like to dynamically set the disk requirements based on a recent continuous build directory (cross-build?).  

Looking for a number like this:

```
# From a recent release build on my machine
$ df -sh anago-v1.5.0-alpha.1
32G anago-v1.5.0-alpha.1
```
## 

Some thoughts from the seeding email thread:

@ixdy said: 

The crossbuild is happening inside docker, and there are likely simultaneous builds happening at the same time. We might be able to query docker for what the volume sizes are, though I'm not sure exactly how best to do that.
## 

As some point of reference for places we might look for info, cross-build is currently running on agent-heavy-6.

# du -sh _output
3.3G    _output
```

We could maybe run `du` on the _output dir at the end of runs and save that in metadata somewhere? Not perfect, but it's a start of a metric.
## 

Disk usage shoots up a bit when producing the docker images and tarballs:

```
5.9G    _output/dockerized
20M     _output/images
9.2G    _output/release-stage
2.6G    _output/release-tars
```

Anyway, we should probably figure out some way of saving the size of _output in structured metadata. At the very least, we could just run `du -sh _output` in the build script, so a human can periodically easily update the thresholds. (We already run sha256sum for presumably similar reasons.)

That only works if the elements after `in` are a shell array--which they used to be, but the elements were moved into a variable (PR https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/131) so they are now evaluated as one big element -- hence the check fails for all users.

The fix replaces the pipe character in the `ACL_LIST` with a new line, and then greps for the specified user. If the value is found the check is passed, if it is not the check fails.

No, there's no GitHub API that allows you to do exactly what you want, but there's still a way you can help yourself and both speed things up + reduce the number of API calls. Instead of hitting the API over and over again, add a webhook to the project which notifies you when a label has been added or removed from an issue or pull request: http://developer.github.com/webhooks/. That webhook would be pointed at the same system that's doing the API calls right now and that system would store that information locally so that when it needs to know if a pull request has a label -- it doesn't need to make the API call because it already has all the information it needs. In short, you'd cache the information you need locally instead of hitting the API. That should be both faster and reduce the number of API requests.

An alternative to this would be to do what I suggested before -- I think that suggestion is still valid. If you know which label you're looking for, then you can fetch the list of pull requests with that label via the API (by not fetching them individually, but by fetching 100 at a time, which will be 100 times more efficient than what you're doing now). If you then locally do an intersection of that list with the list of pull requests you compiled with the git log command you shared -- that should give you the list of pull requests you need (pull requests that are between some tags AND have label X). Even if you have multiple labels you need to check for -- this approach should still help you significantly reduce the number of API calls you need to make (you could do additional filtering locally, for example, because the list of pull requests you'd get from the API would include the full list of labels, so no need to hit the API again). Does that make sense for your use-case
 ? If not, can you share more details so that we can understand why it doesn't?

I eventually intend to pull all of the arch-specific binaries out of `kubernetes.tar.gz`, and we should probably stop uploading `kubernetes.tar.gz` to GitHub, instead just referring to the GCS path (and eventually dl.k8s.io).

Before we get there, I want to at least start advertising that we have arch-specific tarballs available.

Another alternative to listing all the tarballs here is to just link to gcsweb (e.g. http://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-release/release/v1.4.1), though that's not TLS-enabled yet, and it's not particularly user-friendly, either.

We could also just list all of the downloads in the releases page instead of the CHANGELOG. WDYT?

I've been using the .spec file in this repo to produce and test ARM64 rpm packages for kubernetes[0]. I'd like to get rid of this forked work, and include it in the official .spec file. Is there interest in building rpms for multiple architectures? If so, I can send a PR to enable multiarch, and by default build packages for x86_64/ARM/ARM64.

If a package installs files into /opt it may only use directories in the /opt/fedora hierarchy. Fedora attempts to organize this directory by allocating a subdirectory of our /opt/fedora directory for specific subsystems. If you think you need to use /opt/fedora please file an FPC ticket to decide whether it's a valid use of /opt and what subdirectory should be allocated for your use.

Release for the `manifest-tool` binary: https://github.com/luxas/manifest-tool/releases/tag/v0.3.0

So basically, when pulling an `${registry}/${binary}:${version}` image, docker will check which platform it is on and redirect and pull layers from the `${registry}/${binary}-${arch}:${version}` image instead. But the image name will always be `${registry}/${binary}:${version}`, so this is a true multi-platform image!

You have to be logged in to a docker registry with `docker login` so I added that part as well.

I can't test this, but I'm quite confident it will work, I've done the same thing for a lot of other images.

The basic workflow is that you'd call `anago --rc release.1.6` once we want to cut the first release candidate, and that'll create `v1.6.0-rc.1`. Any `anago` calls after that (with or without `--rc`) will create `-rc.2`, `-rc.3`, etc. Passing `--official` will produce the `v1.6.0` build.

It would not surprise me if there are some bugs or incorrect assumptions in some of the logic here (it's kinda hard to test). It'd be good to double-check the auto-generated versions (for all branches, not just 1.6) until we're certain it's working properly.

When installing Kubernetes packaging using `apt` as per [these intructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/), one gets versions `1.5.2` at the moment (see [here](https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/dists/kubernetes-xenial/main/binary-amd64/Packages)) under Ubuntu Xenial:
```
[...]
Package: kubectl
Version: 1.5.2-00
[...]
Package: kubelet
Version: 1.5.2-00
[...]
```

**What you expected to happen**:

Either get `1.5.4` as it was happening last week/the week before; **or** get `1.5.5` given it has been released [since then](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.5.5) and is returned by:
```
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt
v1.5.5
```
I certainly did *not* expect a rollback to `1.5.2`.

**How to reproduce it**:

Under a machine with Ubuntu Xenial:
```
# apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https

release,sdake,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/305,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/305,RPMs should be gated with kubeadm and then tagged,"This repository builds kubeadm RPMs, however nothing is gated as evidenced by the chaos caused during the release of 1.6 of kubernetes.  Constantly gating the built RPMS would validate their correctness.

In upstream kolla-kubernetes (http://github.com/openstack/kolla-kubernetes) we do gate the Kubernetes generated RPMs - perhaps there is something useful to be learned from our gating tools.

We have a couple work in progress  patches which might also help correct some issues found in the existing packaging:

As kubeadm beta was deleted, I attempted to build from this repository what I thought were the correct RPMs.  Since nothing was tagged in this repository, it was possible this was done incorrectly.  Anything without ""multi"" in it indicates a kubeadm init only was used.  A multi gate job means kubeadm join is used (which blocks on a certificate failure).

The rpm package of  kubernetes-cni depends on kubelet and the rpm package of kubelet depend on kubernetes-cni as described here https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/rpm/kubelet.spec

This makes a circular dep. Do you agree guys that we can remove the dependency of kubelet from the kubernetes-cni package? If so I can do a PR for you.

With the gcloud version noted below, the command returns:
```shell
$ gcloud auth list
        Credentialed Accounts
ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
        foo@bar.com
*       some.user@gmail.com

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`

$
```
Which no longer matches the ""- name"" test (there's no dash).

One option is to use:
```shell
$ gcloud auth list --format=""value(account)""
foo@bar.com
some.user@gmail.com
```
Which only shows the user names.

Another option would be to drop the first part altogether, since the second part essentially repeats the test, making the first redundant.

```shell

After chatting with @DirectXMan12 about what the cAdvisor port actually is used for, I realized that we might be able to turn it off. I tested it locally and it worked just fine, heapster could fetch metrics normally.

Problem: Many kubeadm users spawn their clusters on public VMs from providers like DigitalOcean, Packet, GCE or their own solution where the master has a public IP to the internet. Currently, the `4194` cAdvisor port, is **exposed publicly to anyone**. If the machine has a public IP address; it is **publicly exposed to the internet**. Most users don't know about this nor that they should block `4194` in their firewalls. However, that's unnecessarily complex when we can disable it on the kubelet side. 

Proposed solution: Disabling the publicly available port. Only running cAdvisor internally in the kubelet. cAdvisor metrics are available anyway from `{node-ip}:10250/stats`, but this time with proper authentication and authorization.",closed,True,2017-06-26 07:25:30,2017-06-29 11:14:50

* the version of docker on Jenkins is old enough (1.9.1) that it doesn't embed `manifest.json` in saved docker images.

Fixing this on Jenkins is a nontrivial process; until we do that, there are hacky workarounds.

If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there and close this page.

If you have not found any duplicates, delete this section and continue on.


## Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?

Choose one: BUG REPORT

## Versions

**kubeadm version** (use `kubeadm version`): v1.8.0-beta1

**Environment**:
- **Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): v1.7.3
- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration**: none
- **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu Xenial
- **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`):
- **Others**:


## What happened?
In kubeadm v1.7.3, /etc/kubernetes is mounted directly on kube-apiserver static pod. This allows me to specify `basic-auth-file: /etc/kubernetes/users/known_users.csv` in the apiServerExtraArgs section. In v1.8.0-beta1, this mount was removed. Now only very specific mounts are made. If I move my users file into my pki dir, then it could be seen, but I don't prefer to store my user file there.

## What you expected to happen?
Keep /etc/kubernetes mount or make an option to specify extra mount volumes.

## How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?
Add to kubeadm config YAML:
Create a basic auth csv file.
```
apiServerExtraArgs:
  basic-auth-file: /etc/kubernetes/users/known_users.csv
```

## Anything else we need to know?
There should be an option to make extra mounts for static pods.",closed,False,2017-09-12 20:11:34,2018-02-02 19:09:53

release,kad,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/415,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/415,Publish produced from bazel builds deb and rpm packages,"I would like to discuss possibility to improve release scripts and CI jobs to be able to publish
packages produced during bazel builds for all branches. 

I would like to propose also list of repositories that would be matching labels that are used in CI (latest-1.x, stable-1.x, etc).

Naming convention I suggest to use: `kubernetes-$distro-$arch-$ci_label`

For example, for RPMs it would be something like: this under https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos 

```
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-stable-1
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-stable-1.8
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-latest-1
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-latest-1.8
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-latest-1.9
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-ci-latest-1
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-ci-latest-1.8
kubernetes-el7-x86_64-ci-latest-1.9
```

For Debian/APT based repositories, I'd suggest to use  similar naming schema, but without `$arch`:
```
kubernetes-xenial-stable-1
kubernetes-xenial-stable-1.8
kubernetes-xenial-latest-1
kubernetes-xenial-latest-1.8
kubernetes-xenial-latest-1.9
kubernetes-xenial-ci-latest-1
kubernetes-xenial-ci-latest-1.8
kubernetes-xenial-ci-latest-1.9
```

Those repositories would be good if they will be populated in similar time and way when `gs://kubernetes-release/release/*.txt` and `gs://kubernetes-release-dev/ci-cross/*.txt` are populated. 
Examples:
-  once 1.8.2 is published and `gs://kubernetes-release/release/stable-1.8.txt` updated for it, set of packages should be uploaded to repository `kubernetes-el7-x86_64-stable-1.8` and corresponding deb `kubernetes-xenial-stable-1.8`. 
- once CI finishes build for branch, corresponding packages uploaded to `kubernetes-xenial-ci-latest-1.8` or similarly `kubernetes-el7-x86_64-ci-latest-1.8`. 


Related: kubernetes/kubernetes#53163 - this makes packages produced during bazel build usable on x86-64. Not ideal case, as we don't have multi-arch support, but better than nothing for now for testing.

I don't have enough knowledge of k8s CI and release infra to develop that myself, but hope people who knows more about it will be able to comment and maybe guide on how to implement that idea.

release,roycaihw,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/434,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/434,Golang implementation of release note generating tool,"To better produce human-readable release note for Kubernetes. We proposed a [hierarchical release note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zruAySDv6pewhdrAA36uG86Y3mL_8OCkZcMnxuzR81A) (designe doc shared with kubernetes-dev@ mailing list) design. 

The implementation is divided into two PRs for easier review & test. This PR contains a Golang implementation of existing release note generating tool [relnotes](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/relnotes). The second PR focus on the new hierarchical feature and can be reviewed after this one is merged.

**Notes for reviewer:** 
1. This PR contains three commits. The first two commits add vendor dependency and bazel build rule changes for Golang. The third commit focus on the implementation.

2. Unit tests are implemented for util functions and main function.

3. To build, run:
`dep ensure`
`bazel run //:gazelle`
`bazel build toolbox/relnotes:relnotes`

4. Some e2e tests against the existing shell script relnotes (assume currently in a kubernetes repo):
_i)
On branch release-1.7 (run `make quick-release` to generate the release tarballs):_
Golang program (the program takes about 15 minutes to run):

Script program:
`../release/relnotes v1.7.0..v1.7.2 --preview --htmlize-md --html-file=/tmp/relnotes-testfile.html --release-tars=_output/release-tars`
_ii)

release,david-mcmahon,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/448,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/448,"Workflow state, re-entrancy, GCB support.","Workflow state:
* A predefined workflow based on command-line flags is established and presented to the user upon start
* The state is managed in a simple text file `/tmp/anago-runstate` using the names of the entry points, arguments passed in to those entry points and name=value pairs of globals set in those entry points that are saved along with the rest of the state.

Re-entrancy:
* The flow is a mix of stateful and stateless entry points.  The stateless ones are mostly informational and not enumerated in the workflow
* The program can exit at any time for any reason and is fully re-entrant

GCB Support
* Additional splitting up of the build and artifact bundling steps to support GCB calling directly with the kube-cross image
* Setting of a global TMPDIR to make use of the GCB persistent disk
* `--prebuild` and `--buildonly` are added exclusively for use with `--gcb`

Additional fixes/changes to the staging functionality
* Move the disk_space_check to where accurate values can be calculated based on found (or not found) staging areas
* Simplify the staging further by limiting it to all local or all GCS.  The mix provided minimal benefit for added complexity.  The typical use cases don't support the added complexity.

release,david-mcmahon,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/465,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/465,git checkout -B resets existing branches.  Check if branch exists.,"The recent change adding staging and workflow re-entrancy required lots of context switching and introduced checkout_object() which was refactored from some existing code.  With new flexibility comes new requirements to ensure we're not using -B when we shouldn't as well as not rebasing master after files have changed in the case where a new branch requires an update to` api/openapi-spec/swagger.json`.  Getting rid of that requirement would be ideal, but short of that tagging prior to modifying that file avoids the trouble on the master branch

On the release-* branches, the trouble was that immediately after prepare_tree() set up the branch, tags and updates, build_tree() came along and -B reset the branch to the right/same commit, but clearing all the prepare_tree() activity.

Additionally:
* Do away with the potentially damaging gitlib::git_push_access() in favor of gitlib::is_repo_admin().
* Also handle recent move of federation out of k/k.
* And some additional notes about branching from master.
* Better highlighting of --clean when command-line options change

major.minor.patch-release values instead of having them hard-coded in
the spec file.

Other changes include:

- Upgrade image to fedora:27

- Only copy the spec file to SPECS

- Copy the common source files to /root/common-sources (and then into
  each arch's source directory at build time)

- Clean the output directory prior to creating the kubelet-rpm-builder
  image

- Bind mount the source directories into the container so downloaded
  sources are preserved

- Add an optional environment variable, KEEP_SOURCES, that preserves
  files in the bind mounted source directories (avoiding the need to
  re-download source files, or allowing you to ""bring your own"")

It is possible the way relnotes automatically constructs a range with on a single arg (v1.7.14) is to blame as the notes generated correctly when specifying v1.7.13..v1.7.14.  Though the fact that it worked for 1 out of 3 is suspect for something transient.  This has never happened previously.

Each update keeps overwriting the customisation one has to do when configuring kubelet.
Kubelet's options should not be put in an override.
One option for packaging is to put all variables in a /etc/sysconfig/<kubelet> and source this file in the kubelet service unit.
Something like this :

[Unit]
Description=kubelet: The Kubernetes Node Agent
Documentation=http://kubernetes.io/docs/

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/kubelet
ExecStart=/usr/bin/kubelet $KUBELET_ARGS
Restart=always
StartLimitInterval=0
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

This way, one has to build the option line in the /etc/sysconfig/kubelet.
There is no need to do systemctl daemon-reload when the configuration options of kubelet are modified.
This way kubelet options are kept in a configuration file separated from the service unit file.

## Building

To build the `release-notes` tool, check out this repo to your `$GOPATH`:

```
git clone git@github.com:kubernetes/release.git $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/release
```

Run the following from the root of the repository to install dependencies:

```
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
dep ensure -vendor-only
```

Run the following from the root of the repository to build the `release-notes` binary:

```
go build ./cmd/release-notes
```

Use the `-h` flag for help:

```
./release-notes -h
```

## Running

To generate release notes for a commit range, run:

```
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=a_github_api_token
$ ./release-notes \
  -start-sha d0a17cb4bbdf608559f257a76acfaa9acb054903 \
  -end-sha   91e7b4fd31fcd3d5f436da26c980becec37ceefe

level=info msg=""release notes markdown written to file"" path=/var/folders/wp/6fkmvjf11gv18tdprv4g2mk40000gn/T/release-notes-048706664
```

You can also generate the raw notes data into JSON. You can then use a variety of tools (such as `jq`) to slice and dice the output:

```json
[
  {
    ""text"": ""fixed incorrect OpenAPI schema for CustomResourceDefinition objects"",
    ""author"": ""liggitt"",
    ""author_url"": ""https://github.com/liggitt"",

    ""kinds"": [

    ""sigs"": [

  }
]
```

## FAQ

### What do generated notes look like?

Check out the rendering of 1.11's release notes [here](https://gist.github.com/marpaia/acfdb889f362195bb683e9e09ce196bc).

### What about the `relnotes` shell script? And the `relnotes` go tool?

I'd like to deprecate both of those tools and make sure that whatever automated needs people have can be satisfied by the `k8s.io/release/pkg/notes` package.

### Why formats are supported?

Right now the tool can output release notes in Markdown and JSON.

### Where are the Bazel configs?

I can for sure add bazel configs if we want, but `go build ./cmd/release-notes` isn't so bad :)

### Why isn't this in `toolbox/`

IMO the pattern for Go tools is minimal main files in `cmd/toolname` and well-structured libraries in `pkg/`. Once this is meeting everyone's needs, I'd love to remove `toolbox/` and use this pattern for this repo.",closed,True,2018-07-01 09:35:59,2018-08-01 02:45:20

https://kubernetes.slack.com/conversation/C2C40FMNF/p1513780901000151.

I was specifically curious about the RPM spec file, as it has hard-coded values for the major, minor, and patch versions of Kubernetes, and these were out of date at the time (they were for 1.8.x).

@enisoc wrote there are some Google-internal scripts that modify the spec file to update the versions, but for patch releases, those updates are not checked in. Looking at recent history, the spec file jumped from 1.9.0 to 1.11.0, which highlights a gap.

I would like to see these updates checked in if possible, so the community can see the exact spec files used to create the RPMs.

It would also be nice if we come up with a strategy to make it easy to see spec files for different versions (1.10.x vs 1.11.x ...). This could be done with branches/tags in this repository, or with multiple copies of the spec (1 per minor version). I think branches/tags probably makes more sense, but we should keep all the options on the table and discuss.",open,False,2018-07-24 16:00:32,2019-03-24 21:56:16

release,chuckha,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/609,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/issues/609,Improve kubernetes release process,"# How Release Works

The master branch of the release repo is used to build and release the expected kubernetes packages. The release project will checkout various versions of kubernetes, build the artifacts and release them. 

## The Problem

kubectl, kubeadm, kubelet, and any other rpm/deb package built by the release process suffers from being coupled with the release process and not the code it is building.

The problem with the build and release process being coupled is that different artifacts are built based on the code version, but the release process that defines part of the build is always the same for all versions being built. This causes errors such as v1.8.15 depending on cri-tools when v1.8.15 does not have any of the code necessary to make this dependency make sense. 

## Moving forward

I would like to start collecting information about the blockers for making bazel build process in kubernetes/kubernetes the canonical source.

Improving packaging is out of scope for this ticket. I want to focus this ticket on the release process.

Ideally we would build a web of trust including the patch/branch managers and use keys when building the artifacts at the same time as we generate the md5 and sha1/512 manifests. We could have a signing party at kubecon to kick off the web of trust too!

One temporary solution here is to increase the timeout and maybe bump the periodic interval. Another solution is to disable this job as it provides no signal for us anyway.

I think the main problem is [this logic](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/debian/build.go#L198). This builds 5 architectures * 5 packages * 10 distros * 3 versions (stable,unstable,nightly) which is 750 debian packages every time this job runs. It's actually a little bit less than 750 but it's close enough.

> It is true that debian marks files under /etc as conf files, but whether to overwrite or not if both files changed is [determined](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ap-pkg-conffiles.html#automatic-handling-of-configuration-files-by-dpkg) by an interactive prompt to the user by default. This will of course fail if updating non-interactively via scripts unless you supply your preferred version using `-y -o Dpkg::Options::=""--force-confnew""`.

It seems for a release note like

```release-note

        # Delete resources from a directory containing kustomization.yaml.

        # List resources from a directory containing kustomization.yaml
        kubectl get -k dir
```
`````

the first line's `#` is interpreted as a markdown heading command, despite the fact that the whole release note is indented and should probably be treated as a code block.

Firstly, why has the download path specified been ignored?  This behaviour isn't occuring with any other repos I am syncing.  Secondly, whats with the hash at the beginning of the filename?
