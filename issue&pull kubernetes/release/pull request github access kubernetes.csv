release,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/pulls/50,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/50,dgoodwin,WIP: Add kubelet RPM package builds.,"First attempt at the RPMs requested in issue #37. 

This is intended to be relatively self contained build process that can hopefully be integrated into the larger k8s release process, just drop into the
directory and run the build-docker.sh script to launch a Docker
container with appropriate rpm/yum tooling.

Resulting rpms and yum repository metadata will appear in output/
sub-directory and can then just be rsynced, after which client systems just need a simple yum repository file similar to this one I tested with (don't try to use it it's not publically accessible):

```
[root@centos1 ~]# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo 
[kubernetes]
name=K8s Repository
baseurl=http://file.rdu.redhat.com/~dgoodwin/kubernetes-rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

I took an alternate naming scheme from the Debian equivalent in #35 and packaged this as ""kubernetes"" rather than ""kubelet"", the reasoning behind this was that between hyperkube, an possible incoming rename to kube, self-hosting, and discussion around kube-master and kube-node etc, I don't know as the kubelet name will survive as the thing a user should be thinking to install. ""kubernetes"" however, should remain constant at least as a base package in all of this and wherever we end up. This also more closely matches the Fedora RPM packaging today which is further decomposed into the following packages: 

kubernetes.x86_64 : Container cluster management
kubernetes-client.x86_64 : Kubernetes client tools
kubernetes-node.x86_64 : Kubernetes services for node host
kubernetes-master.x86_64 : Kubernetes services for master host

And I suspect we may want to synchronize approaches in the future depending on how all the binary renames play out.

That only works if the elements after `in` are a shell array--which they used to be, but the elements were moved into a variable (PR https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/131) so they are now evaluated as one big element -- hence the check fails for all users.

The fix replaces the pipe character in the `ACL_LIST` with a new line, and then greps for the specified user. If the value is found the check is passed, if it is not the check fails.

Thanks to @bowei for help debugging and fixing.

I eventually intend to pull all of the arch-specific binaries out of `kubernetes.tar.gz`, and we should probably stop uploading `kubernetes.tar.gz` to GitHub, instead just referring to the GCS path (and eventually dl.k8s.io).

Before we get there, I want to at least start advertising that we have arch-specific tarballs available.

Another alternative to listing all the tarballs here is to just link to gcsweb (e.g. http://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-release/release/v1.4.1), though that's not TLS-enabled yet, and it's not particularly user-friendly, either.

We could also just list all of the downloads in the releases page instead of the CHANGELOG. WDYT?

More information: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/multi-platform.md

Release for the `manifest-tool` binary: https://github.com/luxas/manifest-tool/releases/tag/v0.3.0

So basically, when pulling an `${registry}/${binary}:${version}` image, docker will check which platform it is on and redirect and pull layers from the `${registry}/${binary}-${arch}:${version}` image instead. But the image name will always be `${registry}/${binary}:${version}`, so this is a true multi-platform image!

You have to be logged in to a docker registry with `docker login` so I added that part as well.

I can't test this, but I'm quite confident it will work, I've done the same thing for a lot of other images.

Can we merge this and produce an `v1.6.0-alpha.1` release?
Thanks in advance

The basic workflow is that you'd call `anago --rc release.1.6` once we want to cut the first release candidate, and that'll create `v1.6.0-rc.1`. Any `anago` calls after that (with or without `--rc`) will create `-rc.2`, `-rc.3`, etc. Passing `--official` will produce the `v1.6.0` build.

It would not surprise me if there are some bugs or incorrect assumptions in some of the logic here (it's kinda hard to test). It'd be good to double-check the auto-generated versions (for all branches, not just 1.6) until we're certain it's working properly.

After chatting with @DirectXMan12 about what the cAdvisor port actually is used for, I realized that we might be able to turn it off. I tested it locally and it worked just fine, heapster could fetch metrics normally.

Problem: Many kubeadm users spawn their clusters on public VMs from providers like DigitalOcean, Packet, GCE or their own solution where the master has a public IP to the internet. Currently, the `4194` cAdvisor port, is **exposed publicly to anyone**. If the machine has a public IP address; it is **publicly exposed to the internet**. Most users don't know about this nor that they should block `4194` in their firewalls. However, that's unnecessarily complex when we can disable it on the kubelet side. 

Proposed solution: Disabling the publicly available port. Only running cAdvisor internally in the kubelet. cAdvisor metrics are available anyway from `{node-ip}:10250/stats`, but this time with proper authentication and authorization.","['mtaufen', 'liggitt', 'mikedanese', 'dchen1107']",1,2017-06-26 07:25:30,2017-06-29 11:14:50,2017-06-29 11:14:50,True,2017-06-29 11:14:50,luxas,unknown,,closed

* the version of docker on Jenkins is old enough (1.9.1) that it doesn't embed `manifest.json` in saved docker images.

Fixing this on Jenkins is a nontrivial process; until we do that, there are hacky workarounds.

release,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/pulls/434,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/434,roycaihw,Golang implementation of release note generating tool,"To better produce human-readable release note for Kubernetes. We proposed a [hierarchical release note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zruAySDv6pewhdrAA36uG86Y3mL_8OCkZcMnxuzR81A) (designe doc shared with kubernetes-dev@ mailing list) design. 

The implementation is divided into two PRs for easier review & test. This PR contains a Golang implementation of existing release note generating tool [relnotes](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/relnotes). The second PR focus on the new hierarchical feature and can be reviewed after this one is merged.

**Notes for reviewer:** 
1. This PR contains three commits. The first two commits add vendor dependency and bazel build rule changes for Golang. The third commit focus on the implementation.

2. Unit tests are implemented for util functions and main function.

3. To build, run:
`dep ensure`
`bazel run //:gazelle`
`bazel build toolbox/relnotes:relnotes`

4. Some e2e tests against the existing shell script relnotes (assume currently in a kubernetes repo):
_i)
On branch release-1.7 (run `make quick-release` to generate the release tarballs):_
Golang program (the program takes about 15 minutes to run):
`../release/bazel-bin/toolbox/relnotes/relnotes --preview --htmlize-md --html-file /tmp/release-note-html-testfile --release-tars=_output/release-tars v1.7.0..v1.7.2`
Script program:
`../release/relnotes v1.7.0..v1.7.2 --preview --htmlize-md --html-file=/tmp/relnotes-testfile.html --release-tars=_output/release-tars`
_ii)
On branch release-1.7:_
Golang program:
`../release/bazel-bin/toolbox/relnotes/relnotes --preview --html-file /tmp/release-note-html-testfile --release-tars=_output/release-tars v1.7.0..v1.7.0`
Script program:
`../release/relnotes v1.7.0..v1.7.0 --preview --html-file=/tmp/relnotes-testfile.html --release-tars=_output/release-tars`
_iii)

Script program:
`../release/relnotes --html-file=/tmp/relnotes-testfile.html --full`

5. To compare the output:
`vimdiff /tmp/relnotes-release-1.7.md /tmp/release-notes-release-1.7.md`

* A predefined workflow based on command-line flags is established and presented to the user upon start
* The state is managed in a simple text file `/tmp/anago-runstate` using the names of the entry points, arguments passed in to those entry points and name=value pairs of globals set in those entry points that are saved along with the rest of the state.

Re-entrancy:
* The flow is a mix of stateful and stateless entry points.  The stateless ones are mostly informational and not enumerated in the workflow
* The program can exit at any time for any reason and is fully re-entrant

GCB Support
* Additional splitting up of the build and artifact bundling steps to support GCB calling directly with the kube-cross image
* Setting of a global TMPDIR to make use of the GCB persistent disk
* `--prebuild` and `--buildonly` are added exclusively for use with `--gcb`

Additional fixes/changes to the staging functionality
* Move the disk_space_check to where accurate values can be calculated based on found (or not found) staging areas
* Simplify the staging further by limiting it to all local or all GCS.  The mix provided minimal benefit for added complexity.  The typical use cases don't support the added complexity.

release,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/pulls/465,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/465,david-mcmahon,git checkout -B resets existing branches.  Check if branch exists.,"The recent change adding staging and workflow re-entrancy required lots of context switching and introduced checkout_object() which was refactored from some existing code.  With new flexibility comes new requirements to ensure we're not using -B when we shouldn't as well as not rebasing master after files have changed in the case where a new branch requires an update to` api/openapi-spec/swagger.json`.  Getting rid of that requirement would be ideal, but short of that tagging prior to modifying that file avoids the trouble on the master branch

On the release-* branches, the trouble was that immediately after prepare_tree() set up the branch, tags and updates, build_tree() came along and -B reset the branch to the right/same commit, but clearing all the prepare_tree() activity.

Additionally:
* Do away with the potentially damaging gitlib::git_push_access() in favor of gitlib::is_repo_admin().
* Also handle recent move of federation out of k/k.
* And some additional notes about branching from master.
* Better highlighting of --clean when command-line options change

- Fix `Source5` parse problem with Kubernetes < 1.9.0
- Extract `cni-plugins` to its own directory and fix `mv` commands

See the newer commit for my fixes. I've tested that the rpms actually build for both Kubernetes 1.8.x and 1.9.0-beta.2, and that their contents look reasonable, but haven't actually started real clusters using them for deep end-to-end testing (yet).

release,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/release/pulls/575,https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/575,marpaia,"A tool for fetching, contextualizing, organizing, and rendering release notes","This PR adds a tool called `release-notes` and a set of library utilities at `k8s.io/release/pkg/notes` which aim to provide a simple and extensible set of tools for fetching, contextualizing, and rendering release notes.

## Building

To build the `release-notes` tool, check out this repo to your `$GOPATH`:

```
git clone git@github.com:kubernetes/release.git $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/release
```

Run the following from the root of the repository to install dependencies:

```
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
dep ensure -vendor-only
```

Run the following from the root of the repository to build the `release-notes` binary:

```
go build ./cmd/release-notes
```

Use the `-h` flag for help:

```
./release-notes -h
```

## Running

To generate release notes for a commit range, run:

```
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=a_github_api_token
$ ./release-notes \
  -start-sha d0a17cb4bbdf608559f257a76acfaa9acb054903 \
  -end-sha   91e7b4fd31fcd3d5f436da26c980becec37ceefe
level=info msg=""fetching all commits. this might take a while...""
level=info msg=""got the commits, performing rendering""
level=info msg=""release notes markdown written to file"" path=/var/folders/wp/6fkmvjf11gv18tdprv4g2mk40000gn/T/release-notes-048706664
```

You can also generate the raw notes data into JSON. You can then use a variety of tools (such as `jq`) to slice and dice the output:

```json
[
  {
    ""text"": ""fixed incorrect OpenAPI schema for CustomResourceDefinition objects"",
    ""author"": ""liggitt"",
    ""author_url"": ""https://github.com/liggitt"",
    ""pr_url"": ""https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65256"",
    ""pr_number"": 65256,
    ""kinds"": [
      ""bug""
    ],
    ""sigs"": [
      ""api-machinery""
    ]
  }
]
```

## FAQ

### What do generated notes look like?

Check out the rendering of 1.11's release notes [here](https://gist.github.com/marpaia/acfdb889f362195bb683e9e09ce196bc).

### What about the `relnotes` shell script? And the `relnotes` go tool?

I'd like to deprecate both of those tools and make sure that whatever automated needs people have can be satisfied by the `k8s.io/release/pkg/notes` package.

### Why formats are supported?

Right now the tool can output release notes in Markdown and JSON.

### Where are the Bazel configs?

I can for sure add bazel configs if we want, but `go build ./cmd/release-notes` isn't so bad :)

### Why isn't this in `toolbox/`

IMO the pattern for Go tools is minimal main files in `cmd/toolname` and well-structured libraries in `pkg/`. Once this is meeting everyone's needs, I'd love to remove `toolbox/` and use this pattern for this repo.","['calebamiles', 'ixdy']",31,2018-07-01 09:35:59,2018-08-01 02:45:20,2018-08-01 02:45:20,False,,,unknown,,closed

- Adds a `-branch` flag that defaults to `master` if unset.
- If `-format` is `json` and `-output` is an existing JSON file, the tool will smartly append (update PRs if existing) to the file rather than generate a new one.
- If `-output` file doesn't exist, create it
- Created a map[int]ReleaseNote to allow for smarter merging of new and existing notes (just for JSON output)
- Cleaned up the run function in main.go (thanks @BenTheElder) so logic can get broken out easier.

This will be useful with future endeavors when using the output of this tool. :smile: ","['spiffxp', 'tpepper']",4,2019-03-03 00:09:36,2019-03-23 01:24:50,2019-03-23 01:24:50,True,2019-03-23 01:24:50,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

Remove stale conditional logic.

Required dependency pinning with '=' is failing at the package

version of the dependency in the repo, so don't pin, rather require
'>='.

CNI is required across the board at >= 0.7.5, due to a security
