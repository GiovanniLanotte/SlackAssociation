The step above takes some time.  > 24h I would say. 

here's a snapshot of the k8s LB backend pool after a while, as you can see, we should have `kn-es-0`, `kn-es-1`, `kn-es-2`, ect, in the list and many more. Maybe this is the expected behavior, but it causes the node to not have a valid Outbound IP when it gets allocated again.

- Update the apimodel manifest to v1.14 so that aks-engine can remove deprecated flag
- Update docs where applicable

NOTE: The long term fix to point aks-engine release to a url from storage blob, instead of updating releases, will be in a followup PR after the prow job issue has been fixed.
