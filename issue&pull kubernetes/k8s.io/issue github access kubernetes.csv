```
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/network/flannel.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/network/calico.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/network/weave.yaml

kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/core/dns.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/core/dashboard.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/core/heapster.yaml
...
```

or just 

```
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/flannel.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/calico.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/weave.yaml

kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/dns.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/dashboard.yaml
kubectl apply -f addon(s).k8s.io/heapster.yaml
...
```

This would be very user-friendly, and we should document the possible addons installable this way at the main site.

The more exotic addons could (and should) be kept away from this way of installing the addons, only the most common should be here.

We could just have a redirection file in this repo that points to the source of truth somewhere in the main k8s repo or at other places.

More concrete example: I want to update https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/centos/config-build.sh#L44 to use `https://releases.k8s.io/downloads/release/v${K8S_VERSION}/kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.

* New: support REVIEWABLE_ANALYTICS_URL to allow for tracking of major user
  actions and customized stats. Please see the config guide for details.
* New: enable subscription admin to restrict Reviewable users to members of a set
  of teams. (The default is to continue to allow any GHE user to sign in.)
* Upd: upgrade server environment to Node v6.
* Upd: remove support for GAE_MODULE_INSTANCE, as the new GAE flex environment no
  longer provides this value and AFAIK no other container runner provides an
  ordinal instance number either.
* Upd: have server log errors with full stack traces to console if Sentry
  monitoring not set up.
* Fix: improve workaround for Firebase stuck transaction bug. The condition will
  now be detected earlier, reducing thrashing, and can now recover without
  restarting the instance in many cases.
* Fix: set correct disposition on button-initiated ""Done"" reply when the user is
  the PR author and also a reviewer due to marking files as reviewed. (Yes, all
  of those conditions are necessary to trigger the bug!)
* Fix: handle mixed-case emoji tokens correctly.

* New: allow organization owners to request automatic connection of all
  newly created repos to Reviewable. You can find the new toggles on the
  Repositories page. You can do it for personal repos as well, but the
  reaction to a new repo may be delayed by up to 2 minutes (since there's
  no webhook for personal repo creation).
* Upd: upgrade all connected repos to listen to all GitHub webhook events.
  This process will kick off automatically within minutes of starting up
  the new version and continue (with checkpoints) until finished, probably
  within a few minutes and definitely in less than 30 minutes. (If you're
  doing a rolling upgrade, it may get delayed or start right away — either
  one is fine.) While running, the upgrade process will keep one instance
  pretty busy so you might not want to upgrade during peak hours. If you
  want to follow along, look for log lines with the token ""migrate1549""
  for (minimal) status updates, and a final summary log line starting with
  ""Migrated NNN legacy repositories"" that indicates completion. It's OK
  even if there's a few failures, as any repo that isn't completely idle
  will get updated the next time it sends a webhook anyway. This upgrade
  process just hurries things along.
* Fix: prevent occasional ""permission denied"" crash when upgrading OAuth
  scopes on the Reviews or Repositories page.
* Fix: prune obsolete webhooks more aggressively in case they got migrated
  from github.com to GHE.

1592.2216 (min 1549.2198) 2017-06-07

* Upd: create a sample Reviewable commit status when connecting a repo so
  that it's visible when configuring branch protection settings in GitHub
  before creating a PR.
* Upd: update syntax highlighting module and add Kotlin source file
  extension mappings.
* Fix: correctly enforce minimum version requirements; the previous logic
  was too strict and would disallow rollbacks that should've been
  permitted.",closed,True,2017-06-09 20:32:23,2017-06-09 20:32:41

I'm trying to make a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (macOS package manager) package out of a [go tool I wrote](https://github.com/blendle/kubecrt). In order to do this, I mark packages as dependencies in the package config file for Homebrew.

This looks like this:

```ruby
go_resource ""github.com/spf13/pflag"" do
  url ""https://github.com/spf13/pflag"",
      :revision => ""e57e3eeb33f795204c1ca35f56c44f83227c6e66""

      :revision => ""7d9177d70076375b9a59c8fde23d52d9c4a7ecd5""
end

Looking at this repository, it seems there's an Nginx instance behind `k8s.io` that does some rewriting/redirecting logic based on provided request details.

Since `go get k8s.io/apimachinery` works as expected, I'm wondering if what I want to do is even possible, or not, but I just wanted to point this out, and see if there's a way to make this work.

Now, after hitting this error, I went and refactored my package, so now it only depends on the official Golang package manager `dep`, and I use that to install the required dependencies. In the end, this is the way to go, but I was still interested in the above issues, and wanted to report them here, in case this is something you want to tackle.",closed,False,2017-09-23 08:20:21,2017-09-25 06:24:56

```console
cd k8s.io/
kubectl -n k8s-io-canary apply -f configmap-nginx.yaml
# pick up new configs by forcing nginx to restart
kubectl -n k8s-io-canary scale deployment k8s-io --replicas=0
kubectl -n k8s-io-canary scale deployment k8s-io --replicas=1
TARGET_IP=[canary namespace service IP] make test

# if tests pass, deploy to production
kubectl -n k8s-io-prod apply -f configmap-nginx.yaml
# pick up new configs by forcing nginx to restart
kubectl -n k8s-io-prod scale deployment k8s-io --replicas=0
# note we scale back to 2, not 1
kubectl -n k8s-io-prod scale deployment k8s-io --replicas=2
# verify everything on prod
make test
```

There are lots of steps to automate here:
- restarting nginx manually
- testing on the canary namespace before updating the prod namespace
  - ideally we test before merge even, which is currently a manual process
- requiring a human to deploy changes (rather than automatically updating on merge)

### Existing DNS Record:

NONE

### New DNS Record:

```yaml
# https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind docs (@bentheelder, @munnerz)
kind.sigs:

### Reason for update:

The SIG-Testing [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) subproject has been working on subproject documentation using tooling aligned with SIG-Docs, currently at https://kindocs.netlify.com/ under a Kubernetes-owned Netlify team. 

Ideally we'd like to start using a provider independent URL, `kind.sigs.k8s.io` aligns with our current API namespace, in the future if this pattern works well other subprojects could potentially follow.

The record above follows https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#manual-no-www

> If you are planning to set your site’s custom domain to a non-www subdomain, like blog.yourdomain.com, most of the above instructions won’t be as applicable to you. The things to make sure of are:
>
> 1. You should use a CNAME DNS record for that subdomain to point to your [your-site-name].netlify.com so you can use the CDN.
> 2. You don’t need a www.subdomain.yourdomain.com DNS entry.
> 3. You probably want to stick with your external DNS host. If you use Netlify DNS, you’ll be hosting yourdomain.com with us, not subdomain.yourdomain.com. Netlify DNS can only manage entire DNS zones for root domains.

I've already got cert-manager set up in the cluster, so now it's just a matter of getting the redirector running behind an `Ingress` without breaking anything.

Steps to get there:
1. Teach nginx how to handle forwarded HTTPS requests from the GCP Ingress (since it won't terminate HTTPS directly in this case).
2. Create an `Ingress` to the existing `LoadBalancer` service, using a new static IP as the existing static IP is still bound to the `LoadBalancer`. Use the existing soon-to-expire TLS cert to terminate HTTPS on the `Ingress`.
3. Update DNS records to point to the new static IP and wait for propagation.
4. Switch the service to `NodePort`, releasing the old static IP.
5. Create cert-manager `Certificate` resources - use the Let's Encrypt staging endpoint for canary, and prod endpoint for prod. (Note: because of the large number of subdomains, this creates a lot of backend services at once (~50). We'll need to increase our backend service quota first.)
6. After the TLS cert has been created (may take some time), update the `Ingress` to use the new secret. (I suggest using a new name here, since we'll be using different Let's Encrypt endpoints for canary and prod.)
7. Switch off HTTPS support in nginx and delete the old certificate.
8. Hopefully never think about this again. :)

The bulk of this PR is new logic in the nginx config to properly upgrade HTTP to HTTPS when running behind the `Ingress`, while maintaining existing behavior for clients that connect via the `LoadBalancer` directly.

The `Ingress` has been set up, and tests consistently pass when targeted against it.

After looking at our DNS records, I noticed that testgrid no longer points at the redirector, so we can remove it (and not request its subdomain in our new cert).

The blog now seems to be hosted on https://kubernetes.io/blog, whereas blog.kubernetes.io points at the redirector. This makes both https://blog.kubernetes.io/ and https://blog.k8s.io/ now actually go to the blog.

I also added a handler for `sigs.kubernetes.io`, since that name points at the redirector, though most folks will probably be using sigs.k8s.io.

Commits, in order they should be applied:
1. Add a self-signing dummy `ClusterIssuer`. We'll use this for the canary instance of the redirector, since we can't use Let's Encrypt HTTP challenges since the domains don't point at the canary Ingress.
2. Remove and fix old sites on the redirector. I took this from #218. These are either subdomains that no longer point at the redirector, or are redirections we were doing wrong.
3. Create `Certificate` resources which will generate TLS certificates (saving them into a secret named `k8s-io-tls`). I manually created these lists by looking at the DNS configuration for subdomains that point at the redirector. TODO: better management of these lists.
4. After the new TLS secrets have been created (will take some time), point the `Ingress` at them.
  - Note that I already bumped up our backend services quota on the GCP project to 100.
5. Switch service to `NodePort`, since we can use the `Ingress` exclusively now.
6. Stop serving HTTPS from nginx. (I'll also delete the old secret at this point.)",open,True,2019-04-04 18:22:43,2019-04-05 17:32:31
