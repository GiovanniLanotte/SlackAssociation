* New: support REVIEWABLE_ANALYTICS_URL to allow for tracking of major user
  actions and customized stats. Please see the config guide for details.
* New: enable subscription admin to restrict Reviewable users to members of a set
  of teams. (The default is to continue to allow any GHE user to sign in.)
* Upd: upgrade server environment to Node v6.
* Upd: remove support for GAE_MODULE_INSTANCE, as the new GAE flex environment no
  longer provides this value and AFAIK no other container runner provides an
  ordinal instance number either.
* Upd: have server log errors with full stack traces to console if Sentry
  monitoring not set up.
* Fix: improve workaround for Firebase stuck transaction bug. The condition will
  now be detected earlier, reducing thrashing, and can now recover without
  restarting the instance in many cases.
* Fix: set correct disposition on button-initiated ""Done"" reply when the user is
  the PR author and also a reviewer due to marking files as reviewed. (Yes, all
  of those conditions are necessary to trigger the bug!)
* Fix: handle mixed-case emoji tokens correctly.
* Fix: handle a repo renaming corner case correctly (repo renamed then original
  recreated).",['krousey'],1,2017-01-17 16:36:06,2017-01-17 16:46:48,2017-01-17 16:46:48,True,2017-01-17 16:46:48,thockin,unknown,,closed

* New: allow organization owners to request automatic connection of all
  newly created repos to Reviewable. You can find the new toggles on the
  Repositories page. You can do it for personal repos as well, but the
  reaction to a new repo may be delayed by up to 2 minutes (since there's
  no webhook for personal repo creation).
* Upd: upgrade all connected repos to listen to all GitHub webhook events.
  This process will kick off automatically within minutes of starting up
  the new version and continue (with checkpoints) until finished, probably
  within a few minutes and definitely in less than 30 minutes. (If you're
  doing a rolling upgrade, it may get delayed or start right away — either
  one is fine.) While running, the upgrade process will keep one instance
  pretty busy so you might not want to upgrade during peak hours. If you
  want to follow along, look for log lines with the token ""migrate1549""
  for (minimal) status updates, and a final summary log line starting with
  ""Migrated NNN legacy repositories"" that indicates completion. It's OK
  even if there's a few failures, as any repo that isn't completely idle
  will get updated the next time it sends a webhook anyway. This upgrade
  process just hurries things along.
* Fix: prevent occasional ""permission denied"" crash when upgrading OAuth
  scopes on the Reviews or Repositories page.
* Fix: prune obsolete webhooks more aggressively in case they got migrated
  from github.com to GHE.

1592.2216 (min 1549.2198) 2017-06-07

* Upd: create a sample Reviewable commit status when connecting a repo so
  that it's visible when configuring branch protection settings in GitHub
  before creating a PR.
* Upd: update syntax highlighting module and add Kotlin source file
  extension mappings.
* Fix: correctly enforce minimum version requirements; the previous logic
  was too strict and would disallow rollbacks that should've been
  permitted.",['krousey'],1,2017-06-09 20:32:23,2017-06-09 20:32:41,2017-06-09 20:32:41,True,2017-06-09 20:32:41,thockin,unknown,,closed

Commits, in order they should be applied:
1. Add a self-signing dummy `ClusterIssuer`. We'll use this for the canary instance of the redirector, since we can't use Let's Encrypt HTTP challenges since the domains don't point at the canary Ingress.
2. Remove and fix old sites on the redirector. I took this from #218. These are either subdomains that no longer point at the redirector, or are redirections we were doing wrong.
3. Create `Certificate` resources which will generate TLS certificates (saving them into a secret named `k8s-io-tls`). I manually created these lists by looking at the DNS configuration for subdomains that point at the redirector. TODO: better management of these lists.
4. After the new TLS secrets have been created (will take some time), point the `Ingress` at them.
  - Note that I already bumped up our backend services quota on the GCP project to 100.
5. Switch service to `NodePort`, since we can use the `Ingress` exclusively now.
6. Stop serving HTTPS from nginx. (I'll also delete the old secret at this point.)",['thockin'],6,2019-04-04 18:22:43,,2019-04-05 17:32:31,False,,,unstable,True,open
