---

The AWS cloud provider cluster tag, which defines ownership semantics, is presently being utilised improperly for unrelated purposes. In particular, _attempting_ to identify which instance security groups should be updated to allow inbound load balancer traffic.

This means we (or our controllers) are unable to attach additional security groups to our instances (without ""leaking"" security group resources).

**What would you like to be added**:
[Cluster API Provider AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/blob/master/pkg/cloud/aws/services/cloudformation/bootstrap.go) attempts to use least privileges whereever possible.

The project maintains a copy of the IAM policies used by cloud-provider-aws, but these are permissive compared to the use of IAM conditions in the Cluster API AWS.

If there is consistent tagging in use, then these permissions can be scoped down.

**Why is this needed**:

Enhanced security posture.
