The CSI spec states that it's up to the Plugin to enforce idempotency
on Create and that we do NOT create duplicate named volumes if the same
name is specified in a subsequent Create request.

This patch adds some things to check that:
1. A GetVolumesByName function to openstack_volumes
2. A check in CreateVolume prior to issuing Create to
   see if any volumes with the given Name exist prior
   to Create

If we find a single volume with the given Name we return it.

If we find multiple volumes with the given Name we don't really
have enough info currently to *know* what the right thing is, so
we return an Error.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR modifies the Makefile a bit to give us some flexibility and lay some groundwork for future improvements.  The current Makefile does some work to set a GOPATH and then link the current directory in to a k8s.io directory.  This mostly works, but there can be some problems if you for example aren't in a valid gopath, or if you have multiple development repos being worked on simultaneously.

What this change does is instead takes out the GOPATH setup and symbolic linking, and rather requires that you have the code checked out in a valid GOPATH.  We check for this condition in the Makefile and inform the user with an error if this is not the case.

One other thing we do is move all of the built binaries into a single _out directory, just to help with organization a bit.  This update will also allow us to move the build process into a Container more easily if we decide we'd like to go that way.

This PR adds the implementation for Snapshots support to the CSI/OpenStack provider.  CSI will hopefully be merging Snapshot support soon, and we'll want to update the CSI driver accordingly.

First though, we need to add Snapshot support to the OpenStack Provider for the CSI plugin.  We simply add Create, Delete and List and update our Interface for the OpenStack package.  We also add the new functions to the openstack_mock so that when we add the CSI Controller implementation we can add our tests.

**Which issue this PR fixes** *
partial #136 

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
This just exposes the Snapshot functions we need in Gophercloud

Rather than create another abstraction layer over the response types, I'm just leveraging the Snapshot type from Gophercloud directly.

- folks checking out to a random directory outside their GOPATH
- CI jobs checking out directory to github.com/kubernetes/xyz

both resulting in problems with build, problems updating dependencies, sometimes things work on the dev environment and fail in CI causing folks to scratch their heads.

So let's standardize on the best practice ""this git repo should be checked out under $GOPATH/src/k8s.io"" and enforce it.

This just adds a simple hack/make.sh script to run make directives in a
Docker container.  This means you can run build, test, vet etc on a
repod checked out into any directory on any machine that has Docker.
You aren't required to have a Golang environment or dev environment
setup on your system.

Some may find this useful to simplify the development and test process. 
It's not as useful for dev environments because you presumably will need
a proper Go env to do any dev work, but it's a very lightweight and easy
way to provide a testing environment or to generate builds without any
pre-requisites.

logins and passwords every time in the interactive sessions.
This is not very convenient, so it's better to allow to store
this data in env variables and ask to enter the values only if
they are unset.

This commit adds two new flags for the client-keystone-auth executable:
--user-name and --password, which are defaulted to OS_USERNAME and
OS_PASSWORD respectively.

Addtionally, this commit fixes several small issues:
1. Since Stdout is redirected the executable cannot write data there,
   when the user is asked for his login or password. Therefore, Stderr
   should be used for the output in the interactive sessions.
2. The Exec plugin expects to get expiresAt data in RFC3339Nano format,
   otherwise it is ignored. So the executable converts it before printing.
3. Domain name was defaulted to the string ""default"". But it's better to
   get this value from OS_DOMAIN_NAME env variable.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: Apply a few fixes that have been queued while the provisioner code was moved to this repo from the kubernetes-incubator.  I would like to focus my development effort now on this repository instead of the old location.

**Which issue this PR fixes**: This PR fixes the provisioning flow when cinder.create takes longer than 5 seconds.  It also makes it easier to use certain iscsi storage where initiatorName is verified during volume attachment.  The rest of the commits make small fixes and refactors to prepare for the addition of cloning support.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Adds Manila external provisioner

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
Originated from [kubernetes-incubator/external-storage](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage). Some of the advantages are: ability to handle different share types, OpenStack credentials are passed per-StorageClass instead of per-provisioner.
I'll add unit tests in the following commits, I'd just like to have some feedback if the design is ok.

Tested with a Ceph cluster + [csi-cephfs](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi) and Kubernetes' CephFS mounter.

request a clone, the user should add a clone request annotation to the PVC:

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: clone-claim
  annotations:
    k8s.io/CloneRequest: default/source-pvc
```

The provisioner will locate the indicated PVC and determine the underlying
associated cinder volume ID.  The provisioner will use this ID as the
source-vol-id parameter when provisioning the new volume resulting in a clone
at the storage level.

Cloning will only work if the cinder backend supports ""smart-cloning"".  This
means that the clone will complete without the need for cinder to perform a
bit-for-bit copy using the host.  Because of this, the cinder provisioner will
not attempt to clone unless the associated storage class contains the
parameter: ""smartclone"" to indicate that volumes provisioned from this storage
class can be cloned correctly.

If the provisioner was able to clone the volume it will apply the
'k8s.io/CloneOf' annotation to the PVC.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
With this change, the k8s-keystone-auth can accept either policy config
file or a configmap name in 'kube-system' namespace, because in real
deployment, it's admin user's responsibility to update the policy file
for authorization.

In order to connect to k8s api, either a kubeconfig file or service
account should be provided.

The next step is to support on-the-fly change for the policy without
restarting k8s-keystone-auth service.

to add a possibility to synchronize projects/namespaces.

In other words, if the user belongs to the project in Keystone, then, when
he attepts to authenticate in Kubernetes using k8s-keystone-auth, a k8s
namespace with the same name as the project id will automatically be
created for him.

To enable the feature two new arguments were added to the k8s-keystone-auth binary:
""--sync-config-file"" - points to a local file with sync configuration.
""--sync-configmap-name"" defines a configmap containing the configuration.
If any of them is set, new namespace will be automatically created when the user is
authenticated in Keystone.

Makes it possible to use existing Manila shares in the manila external-provisioner: the user supplies the share name/ID and the share access ID in StorageClass params.
This has implications on dealing with `reclaimPolicy`: if the share has been created by the external-provisioner, it will be deleted if `reclaimPolicy: Delete`. If the user has supplied share name/ID, it won't delete the underlying share regardless of the reclaim policy.

Added 3 new PV annotations:
- Provision type: can be either dynamic or static (newly created share or an existing one)
- ShareSecretName, ShareSecretNamespace: secret ref for the share secrets

A big chunk of code deals with `shareoptions`, which now supports `value` tag with these options: `optional`, `default=`, `coalesce=`, `requires=`

This commit switches keystone-client-auth on the new api and removes the outdated
one.

The difference between two versions is that in alpha interactive mode was checked
in client-go and provided to the plugin with the environment variable
KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO. In beta the plugin uses a TTY check to determine if it's
appropriate to prompt a user interactively. That's why KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO is
not used anymore and can be removed.

Another change is that ExecCredentialSpec struct doesn't contain any fields now,
which means the plugin shouldn't write anything in this section during printing
response output.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Adds snap building to build a snap for the client-keystone-auth plugin. [Snaps](https://snapcraft.io) are a new package system by Ubuntu. Snaps will run on almost any distro and it's super easy to update them. Snaps will update on the user's machine periodically, so the users will always have the latest version that you publish.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
I have also created a [launchpad team](https://launchpad.net/~cloud-provider-openstack) and a [snap store snap](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/snaps/client-keystone-auth/) for this. The team owns the [launchpad project](https://launchpad.net/cloud-provider-openstack) which watches the github repo and builds snaps automagically. I will finish setting this up once the snapcraft.yaml is in the repo. Another option is to bail on the launchpad builders and use travis to build the snap, which you can read about [here](https://docs.snapcraft.io/build-snaps/ci-integration). The launchpad builders will release the snap to the edge channel only. It is up to something(travis?) to validate those snaps and release them to the stable channel.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds Feature to use Barbican as Key manager service for kubernetes

**Which issue this PR fixes**: 
fixes #44 

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
This Plugin cannot be used in production until[1] in barbican gets implemented.
As per Kubernetes documents[2], we need to return encrypted dek to kubernetes, It stores encrypted dek in etcd, only kek is stored in Key Manager Service. OpenStack Barbican currently does not support to return encrypted secret, It only returns secret id. This Plugin returns the secret id to Kubernetes rather than encrypted secret. It results in problem of storing encrypted data at two different locations and since there is no notification from kuberenetes about secret deletion, user has to manually delete secrets stored in barbican. Once feature[1] gets implemented barbican needs to store only single kek and encrypted secret will be stored in kubernetes etcd only.

Add `cluster` parameter for the driver, admin user could specify the CO's identifier, e.g.  in Magnum, the `cluster` could be the magnum cluster id.

When using cinder-csi-plugin together with kubernetes in the cloud environment, we need some information to recognize the volumes created for the PVs from different kubernetes clusters, which is important for the cloud resource management.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
This PR is only adding cluster name to the driver, so that the driver could pass the cluster name to the cinder volume metadata.

There are several ways to inject the cluster name to the cinder volume property, e.g. kubernetes admin can provide parameters when creating the StorageClass, the cloud admin could config `volume-name-prefix` to include the cluster as part of cinder volume name, etc. However, in order to support a more flexible and extensible way, I prefer to add all those information to the cinder volume medata.

**What this PR does / why we need it**: https://serverfault.com/questions/229331/can-i-have-dots-in-a-hostname the recommendation is that we should not use dots in linux hostnames. If we do not have dots in linux hostnames, we should not have those either in kubernetes nodenames because then `nodename` does not match to `hostname`. This makes huge issues if we are using external cloudprovider plugin and when bootstrapping it.

I'm also the author of octavia-ingress-controller and maintainer of k8s-keystone-auth service. Being one of the owners doesn't mean more power but more responsibilities.

If external network do have multiple subnets, the behaviour usually is that openstack will try to take ip address from the first one. If the first one is full, then it will use the second pool. So if annotation is not defined the behaviour is like that (case web3).

This PR focuses on the scenario of using Octavia, it does several things:
- When creating service, create a new security group and add rules to allow traffic coming from the load balancer subnet IP address range while going to the service nodeport on the nodes. Associate the security group with all the Neutron ports on the nodes, add a tag to the ports.
- When deleting service, disassociate the security group from the Neutron ports on the nodes before removing.

**Which issue this PR fixes**: 
fixes #490

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
Test process for thie PR:
1. Using image `lingxiankong/openstack-cloud-controller-manager:improve-sg`
1. Configuration

    ```
1. The security group of the Neutron ports on the nodes only allows the basic traffic within the kubernetes cluster such as 10250. The default port range for service ports is not exposed. 
1. Create a service of LoadBalancer type.
    ```
    $ kubectl run hostname-server --image=lingxiankong/alpine-test --port=8080
    $ kubectl expose deployment hostname-server --type=LoadBalancer --target-port=8080 --port=80 --name hostname-server

Support security group management in octavia-ingress-controller. In most of the production environments, the security group of the cluster nodes is more strict and the default port range of service ports may not be exposed. As a result, it's neccessary for octavia-ingress-controller to manage the security groups on kubernetes cluster admin's behalf.

This PR introduces a new bool type option `manage_security_groups` in octavia-ingress-controller configuration with the default value `false`, so the ingress controller doesn't manage security groups. The kubernetes cluster admin could change it to `true` so that the security group could be automatically managed.

Requirements to the OpenStack environment:
- Neutron needs to support [Standard Attributes Tag Extension](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/network/v2/index.html#standard-attributes-tag-extension)

Sometimes, we need to know the service IP address before a Service is actually created, so other applications who replies on the Service external IP could be deployed with no dependencies, e.g. the kube-apiserver certificate could be created before the service is actually created.

In order to specify port ID to create Service, a new annotation for Service is introduced, e.g.:
```yaml
annotations:
  loadbalancer.openstack.org/port-id: ""849ee2ed-72a6-44a4-911e-6a8be46dbe8e""
```

Please be aware that after the Service is created, port ID cannot be changed.

cloud-provider-openstack,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/pulls/536,https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/pull/536,gman0,[WIP] CSI Manila driver,"**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Adds CSI Manila driver, currently supports only CephFS and NFS. I've only tested with CephFS so far.

**Which issue this PR fixes**: fixes #394 

### Design considerations / a brief description of what does what

#### ""proxy"" architecture

This CSI driver acts as a provisioner of Manila shares, all node-related operations (attachments, mounts) are carried out by another CSI driver, dedicated for that particular filesystem. This is achieved by forwarding CSI RPCs to the other CSI driver.

For example, creating and mounting a CephFS Manila share would go like this:

CO requests a volume provisioning with `CreateVolume`:
```
                        +--------------------+
                        |       MASTER       |
+------+  CreateVolume  |  +--------------+  |
|  CO  +------------------>+  csi-manila  |  |
+------+                |  +--------------+  |
                        +--------------------+

1. Authenticate with Manila v2 client
2. Create a CephFS share
3. Create a cephx access rule
```

And when CO publishes the volume onto a node with `NodePublishVolume`:
```
                             +--------------------------------------+
                             |                 NODE                 |
+------+  NodePublishVolume  |  +--------------+                    |
|  CO  +----------------------->+  csi-manila  |                    |
+------+                     |  +------+-------+                    |
                             |         |                            |
                             |         | FORWARD NodePublishVolume  |
                             |         V                            |
                             |  +------+-------+                    |
                             |  |  csi-cephfs  |                    |
                             |  +--------------+                    |
                             +--------------------------------------+

1. Authenticate with Manila v2 client
2. Retrieve the CephFS share
3. Retrieve the cephx access rule
4. Connect to csi-cephfs socket
5. Call csi-cephfs's NodePublishVolume, return its response
```

So the intention here is to deal with only Manila side of things, and leave all filesystem specifics to another CSI driver that's specialized for that particular fs.

If connection with the proxy'd CSI driver cannot be established, csi-manila will return an error and will let the CO retry.

Downsides:

From the documentation
> A single instance of the driver may serve only a single Manila share protocol. To support multiple share protocols, multiple deployments of the driver need to be made. In order to avoid deployment collisions, each instance of the driver should be named differently, e.g. `csi-manila-cephfs`, `csi-manila-nfs`.

The initial idea was to encompass all Manila share protocols within a single instance of csi-manila. Due to limitations of CSI, this cannot be achieved and there will have to be multiple instances of csi-manila running in order to support multiple share protocols, one for each. There are couple of RPCs in Node Service that don't bring enough context to decide which proxy'd driver that particular RPC should be forwarded to (e.g. `NodeGetCapabilities` would be ambiguous and we can't know which proxy'd driver should answer) => therefore with current design, there's only a single proxy'd driver per csi-manila instance. Such ""multiplexer"" design is out-of-scope for CSI anyway IMHO.

#### Concurrency

`CreateVolume` is so far the most time-expensive operation in the driver because it waits till the share is in _Available_ state, and for CephFS shares this waiting is even more pronounced because it waits till the Ceph key for the share is available. This means that the CO may retry the `CreateVolume` RPC for the same volume many times before it's actually done creating.

In Kubernetes, this means there will be multiple `CreateVolume` RPCs for the same volume in parallel - which, in our case, doesn't help the situation at all and would only create more unnecessary load on Manila itself. To guard against situations where there's a long running operation, some form of locking needs to be employed.

Using a simple mutex per volume ID would result in this:
```
  R req1             req2             req3

```
_(I really hope these diagrams make at least a bit of sense)_ On the Y axis, there's `T` for time, and on the X axis there's `R` for a request. The first request `req1` locks the mutex and launches a long running operation `op` (taking up 3 time units). The call times out, so the CO decides to retry with `req2` but needs to wait till `req1` finishes so that `req2` may acquire the lock. This pattern may repeat until the call doesn't time-out. There are two problems here: (a) it may take a long time till CO is satisfied with the answer, (b) the long running operation `op` is being run in all of those retries.

`pkg/csi/manila/responsebroker` from this PR tries to tackle the problem (b), and hopes to mitigate (a):
```
  R req1                                             req2                          req3
T -------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+

02| op1                                            |                             |                             |

05| UNLOCK, write success, wait till all Rs finish | wait...                     | LOCK(ack-or-create)...wait  |
06| wait...                                        | LOCK, read response:success | wait...                     |
07| wait...                                        | UNLOCK                      | wait...                     |
08| wait...                                        | RETURN SUCCESS              + LOCK, read response:success |
09| RETURN SUCCESS                                 +                               UNLOCK                      |
10|                                                                                RETURN SUCCESS              +
```
The same scenario as above: `req1` locks the mutex and runs the long running operation `op` and times-out. `req2` will wait till it can acquire the lock, but instead of running `op` again, it reads the response from `req1` and if it's successful, it immediately exits with success. The `responsebroker` basically caches the result of an operation and propagates it to multiple readers. 

This mechanism could be also used to implement a form of journaling: if an error occurs in one call, the future retries would pick up the operation in the exact spot where the previous call had failed - again, saving some load from the backend. Maybe in another PR.

### To be done in this PR

* If an operator wishes to use a custom certificate for authentication, they may use the `os-certAuthority` parameter in Secrets to inject the contents of a PEM cert file. This is the way manila-provisioner does it. The problem here is the size limit: the [CSI spec allows up to 128 bytes](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#size-limits) in `string` fields and a certificate can be obviously larger than that,
* `List*` and `GetCapacity` CSI RPCs need OpenStack credentials, but these RPCs don't carry any Secrets fields. CSI Cinder driver solves this by supplying the driver with a file containing the credentials. It doesn't rely on Secrets supplied by the CO.

**Release note**:
```release-note
added CSI Manila driver
```

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

In [kubernetes/kubernetes/pkg/controller/client_builder.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/bdc013ad57df721a148a5e15953c5a8b67efdeec/pkg/controller/client_builder.go#L174) it attempts to start a watch for new secrets if the secret containing a token for a service account does not exist the first time it checks. Without the watch permission for secrets this crashes the cloud-controller-manager and the pod restarts until the secret does exist.
