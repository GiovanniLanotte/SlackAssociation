BrowserSync (Ports 9090 & 3001  )---->  Dashboard (Port 9091) ----> Kubernetes (Port 8080)

on style discussions, which are now better guarded thanks to ESLint and
clang-format.

On the final note: it does not matter what concrete lint rules are
enforced (e.g., semicolons or nor). The important part is that they are
enforced by a tool and we do not spend time dicussing about them.

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` in one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

- I created a uniqueness check as a reusable directive. We have another uniqueness check implemented differently. Not sure which version is better.

- Improve errors from the backend, e.g. add error codes
- Improve/change presentation of errors
- resource handling seems to be similar in many cases, kind of duplicate code. Maybe we can improve here, too

There is currently a bug when running 'gulp serve:prod' - the namespace creation dialog in the deploy view does not respond (the dialog window does not open). Now looking at it, this was because of the following two issues:
- Some of the referenced functions were actually not @exported, and hence their names were minified => they couldn't be found after compilation in production. I've added the respective @export annotations.
- After fixing the first issue, another problem appeared: apparently the $mdDialog.show() method has problems resolving the template url '/deploy/createnamespace.html' when the app is run in production mode.

Pasting the template directly as shown here works, and this is a quick-fix workaround. Nevertheless, could anyone propose a better method of handling this?

This was due to semver expecting a patch number (e.g. `1.5.0`), while `go version` was returning `go version go1.5 darwin/amd64`.

If the user's Go version is missing a patch number, we can append a patch number of 0 to prevent this error. AFAICT, semver doesn't provide logic for performing this check and transformation, unfortunately, but that would've been preferable.

I've implemented relative time filter which can be used in multiple views. At this point I've added it to replica set details and replica set list. Filter transforms date to relative date string, which can be seen on mocks. Added tests covering all important date units.

There is still one thing to do, but to keep this pull request small I think it will be better to move it to another pull request. The issue is, that at the moment filter uses client side current time and it's invalid in many cases. Date should be taken from server in all cases, that I know. **Please let me know if you have any suggestions how we should solve it**.

@floreks @bryk Can you review?

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/216,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/216,floreks,Resolved circural dependencies issue (#153),"I've been thinking about some good way to resolve this issue (#153).
## Proposals
1. Introduce new module with module constant `states` that can be injected on demand.
2. Introduce new file with const object `states` not related to modules that can be imported on demand.

I've chosen second option as it seems to be cleaner and simpler. There is no need to define additional dependencies between modules and we don't have to inject constant to the function where we want it to be used.
## Architecture

I've externalized all state names to separate `states.js` file in order to get rid of circual dependencies between modules. Currently all modules can import on demand defined object and use its state properties.
## Usage

Usage is pretty straighforward. Just import `states` object and use predefined states f.e. `state.STATE_DEPLOY`.
## Things to improve
- Filename - As it is not related to any module I've chosen simple `states.js`. We can think about better name here
- Filepath - It's part of the global configuration, so I've decided to put it directly under `frontend` folder. Does it need new folder?

Questions? Comments? Any other ideas?

With this pull request I want to start the discussion for the i18n & l10n of the Dashboard project, using 2 concrete tools as a ""proof of concept"" of sorts:
- angular-translate
- Google Closure Templates for translation

I've summarized my knowledge on those two frameworks in the following design document:
https://github.com/taimir/dashboard/blob/i18n-angular-translate/docs/design/i18n.md

They are also discussed in this AngularJS design document, dealing with i18n:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mwyOFsAD-bPoXTk3Hthq0CAcGXCUw-BtTJMR4nGTY-0

This pull request contains a simple integration of angular-translate, please check the changes in the code to get an idea of the basic usage. For a Closure Templates example, please refer to this pull request: https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/252

From my perspective, angular-translate is easier to integrate in our project, but lacks message extraction (into XLIFF files, good for human translators). Closure Templates has this, but does not fit our project that nicely. I really want to hear other opinions on this topic and am open for other tools I could try out.

This would be the counterpart of angular-translate for i18n, as a follow up to https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/251. The pull request contains a mock integration of the Closure Templates into our project. However it has many issues, I still couldn't get the compiled templates to pass through the Closure Compiler for example. 

Please refer to https://github.com/taimir/dashboard/blob/i18n-angular-translate/docs/design/i18n.md for the overview of my thoughts on both tools and check my notes in the first pull request https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/251.

Notice that i18n is not complete here, as I need a way for the server to determine which .js file (for which locale) should be served.

As stated previously, we could go for any of those two options or I could even try some new one if anyone has an idea.

2) validation - regex check to ensure lowercase and hyphens only
3) validation - increased responsiveness by replacing ng-model-options with ng-if=""<model>.$touched""
4) validation - removed md-progress linear which was causing page to jitter (showing progress bar - creating a new line in the form - for fractions of a second and then hiding again). Validation for unique-name still works.
5) validation - for 'number of pods', added validation message for 'required' as it is possible to remove default value.

Layout:
6) layout - set default font-size to 14px
7) layout - adjusted alignment between components within a single row by removing .kd-deploy-input-row formatting in scss and adding md-input-container.
8) layout - renamed 'more options / less options' to 'show advanced options / hide advanced options' to avoid grammatical error and clumsiness of 'more options / fewer options'
9) moved 'show advanced options / hide advanced options' toggle to top of advanced options section to avoid having to scroll down to hide, but also added a 'hide advanced options' button at bottom of advanced options section
10) replaced switches for checkboxes contained in 'div' tags to preserve alignment between checkbox and label.

I've added option to delete services related to replication controller with some tooltip.
## Concept

Let's take simple label selector `{app: test}`

I'm checking if this selector targets only 1 replication controller. This is the most important check, because if there are more replication controllers targeted by this selector then we can not delete any related services.

If there is only 1 replication controller then services targeted by this selector can be deleted.

> I am not fully happy with leaving the link empty on local cluster. What about putting ""localhost:nodeport"" into the link as a fallback if no IP is available? First, I would help us for writing click-tests, because using external link would make the test work on local cluster (CI) and real cluster. Second, the link is an important UI feature, it shouldn't be missing on local cluster

I've set `localhost:targetport` as a external endpoint for cluster IP services. I've used target port instead of nodeport, because it was always 0 during tests. Is it correct?

Please take a look and say your opinion about it. Change is not big, so I can quickly adapt it (for example use node port instead of target port).

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/398,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/398,taimir,Fix for layout compatibility issues with Microsoft Edge,"So this is the first batch of changes I came up with to make the layout work in MS Edge. The biggest change was replacing `flex` with `flex=""auto""` everywhere, because otherwise the parent elements were ""collapsed"" and had height 0 at a number of places throughout dashboard. AFAICS this does not influence the layout in Chrome.

Also there was some trouble with the list of replicaset cards and the ""auto-inference"" of the best height so that a grid can be enforced (cf. algorithm at _replicationcontrollerlistcontainer.js_).  The algorithm works fine, but it seems that Edge fails to adapt the  height of some the direct children of the rc-list container, even if the content enclosed by them is actually bigger in height (I guess some of the grand-children elements are floating). Therefore the cards were cut-off at the bottom, because the algorithm finds appropriate height for the direct children, which is actually not sufficient (since some parents are ""shorter"" than their content).

My approach to this was to introduce a small directive that expands the parent it's put in, so that the parent covers all children even if they are floating. Tell me what you think about this? 

*\* Side note: the algorithm that finds the appropriate height to enforce a ""wrap"" at the _replicationcontrollerlist_ works, but seems a bit hacky to me? Maybe in the future we could actually use `md-grid-list` for this? I just stumbled across the code :)

I think this is also a natural behavior for users to deploy and then check the running application. 

Now, the user could copy & paste the text from the endpoint, but even this is not possible any longer as the text is potentially shortened. 

To solve that, I created a http link for external endpoints. It is also indicated by the mock-ups. 

After thinking about it for a while I realized that this might not be correct all the time.  Nodeports could be anything, e.g. a Minecraft server - not necessarily a HTTP server. In case of GCE load-balancer I am not sure. I assume it is only intended for HTTP...

After contemplating again, I still think I should add such a link. The advantages outweight the disadvantages. Maybe we style it a little bit differently. I am tempted to just add an icon next to the link, like in the mockup.

Any opinion?

Deprecated compiler flags were changed to newly added in favour of https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/1319:
- `manage_closure_compiler` to `dependency_mode`
- `closure_entry_point` to `entry_point`

Additionally some compiler checks had to be turned off because newest `google-closure-library` has some JSDoc issues and compiler complains about that.
## IMPORTANT

It's best to remove current `bower_components` and do a clean install:
`rm -rf bower_components/ && bower install`
`npm install` should be enough to update closure compiler

As for the IE bug it's described here: http://philipwalton.com/articles/normalizing-cross-browser-flexbox-bugs/ in the **The min-height bug** section and in order to make flex container work in the column direction `min-height` needs to be also defined.

I've changed logs toolbar on smaller screens to menu bar in order to fit it in available space.

There is 1 major issue with `md-menu-bar` that I've had to solve using `!important` property in css.

They've solved this issue: https://github.com/angular/material/issues/6049 by changing style of parent `md-toolbar` to `position: relative` in here: https://github.com/angular/material/blob/b58343c20ac4bd3418629c29abddfe3ac3840eb5/src/components/menuBar/js/menuBarController.js#L90

This is changed by code so pure css is not enough to handle this better and in our case we need toolbar to have `position: fixed` that's why I've added `!important`.

I started to implement #509. 

I tried to keep it simple : the code is very similar to the replication controller one. Maybe we could refactor it but : 
- I'm not that good in Go. 
- Types are different in functions parameters, we may need to find a workaround (add an interface and cast object?) 

Feel free to comment!

@zreigz @bryk PTAL

The translations are available when serving with `gulp serve:prod` only (seems reasonable to me). I used [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-language-switcher/pmjbhfmaphnpbehdanbjphdcniaelfie?hl=en) to test. Right now there is an example for a translation in japanese besides english. By default, if there is no translation for a language, english should be shown.

Do you see any issues? Sorry, I know the PR is kind of big, but I wanted to have it in its whole integrity.

It fixes issue with differences between client and server times. Set it up for filter on replication controller list and replication controller detail pages.

There is a way to make it work without need to pass time in HTML, but it will cause performance problems. Current implementation require only one time request per page refresh and if we will move whole logic to filter then we would have `n` requests, where `n` is number of cards on replication controller list page or number of pods on replication controller details page. I think in this case performance is more impotrant.

Fixes #427.

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` in one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

Happy fixing and merging :palm_tree:

Not to be merged. 

it's an example of how kpm could be integrated to dashboard. 

There is an handler in the dashboard-backend to proxy calls to 'kpm-backend' that  performs the communication with the api-master to create/update resources.

kpm-backend has only 2 availables api endpoints:
- POST  /api/v1/deploy/packageName
- POST  /api/v1/delete/packageName

It returns a json with the 'deployment' results:

``` json
{
  ""result"": [
    {
      ""kind"": ""namespace"", 
      ""name"": ""default"", 
      ""namespace"": ""default"", 
      ""package"": ""ant31/rocketchat"", 
      ""status"": ""ok"", 
      ""version"": ""1.6.0""
    }, 
    {
      ""kind"": ""service"", 
      ""name"": ""rocketchat"", 
      ""namespace"": ""default"", 
      ""package"": ""ant31/rocketchat"",

The results is then returned to the dashboard front-end for display.

This change will improve performance of both replication controllers list page and replication controller detail page. Now instead of making N api calls to get pod events there is only 1 API call that gets all events in given namespace and then filters events based on given list of pods.

This should be extended to all places where N api calls are made based on some resource i.e. RCs.

This also fixes #402. When last pod on the list didn't have error, card state was shown as pending.

Introduced `registerValidator` method to allow using them on demand, closer to the place where they are used.

Should we register all validators in one place? Per page or per controller?

First would allow to check for overriding validators. Registering them in controller constructor does not allow that because it may be executed multiple times per page load.

Ideas? Concerns?

This PR set the go deps on v1.2.0 of kubernetes instead of v1.2.0-alpha.7-892-g90a7ac4.

I did a godep update ./... to regenerate workspace that's why there are more diff than just kubernetes deps.
I also adapted the heapster code to make the backend compile with this new dep.

The fact of being based on a stable version of kubernetes make the dashboard more realiable and therefor more usable. 

Please tell me if this is legit to do a such move

> In the simplest terms, the tilde matches the most recent minor version (the middle number). ~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.
> 
> The caret, on the other hand, is more relaxed. It will update you to the most recent major version (the first number). ^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.x release including 1.3.0, but will hold off on 2.0.0.

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/releases/tag/v2.12.1)

<p>As work continues on Browsersync V3, I've decided to take some time to back-port some improvements that have been discovered during the re-write. Many new features are not compatible with the architecture of this 2.x master branch, but those that are have made it into this <code>2.12</code> release. </p>


<h2>Proxy</h2>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Add <code>proxyReq</code> &amp; <code>proxyRes</code> to better align with <a href=""http://urls.greenkeeper.io/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy"">http-proxy API</a></strong> - this allows you to modify the request before and after it hits the target.</li>
<li>
<strong>Remove foxy module, bring proxy code into core</strong>. There was too much duplication &amp; glue-code caused by having the proxy module separate and given they are intrinsically linked, it made sense to keep all of the logic together.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Middleware</h2>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Allow middleware to be registered per-route</strong>. Previously, if you wanted to only apply a middleware based on a route, you had to check the url manually, now you can mix &amp; match 'global' middleware that affect every request with more targeted ones that only act when a particular 
route is hit. (see below for examples)</li>
</ul>


<h2>CLI</h2>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Switch from <code>meow</code> to <code>yargs</code></strong> - for more features re: processing CLI input</li>
<li>
<strong>Allow dot notation</strong> - to enable nested properties (eg: <code>--proxy.ws</code>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Allow multiple items per option</strong> (eg: <code>--files ""*.html"" ""*.css""</code>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Allow per-command help</strong> (eg: <code>browser-sync start --help</code>, <code>browser-sync recipe --help</code> etc)</li>
<li>
<strong>Add short-hand alias for common options</strong> (eg: <code>-s</code> for server, <code>-p</code> for proxy etc)</li>
<li>
<strong>Accept config from <code>browser-sync</code> key in package.json</strong> <a href=""http://urls.greenkeeper.io/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/1040"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/1040"" data-id=""142929802"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#1040</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Allow flags to override all other forms of config</strong> </li>
</ul>


<h2>Plugins</h2>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Allow options in query strings</strong> - a big help when using the cli + plugins 

<ul>
<li>(eg: <code>browser-sync start -s --plugins bs-html-injector?files[]=*.html</code>)</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Snippet</h2>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Append snippet to end of document</strong> - by far the most commonly reported bug is a result of the deliberately simple regex used to insert the script tag directly after the first <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. During testing for V3 I discovered that every single browser that we support is more than happy to accept a JS file that is loaded as the final thing on the page (even after the body/html tags) - this discovery alone should solve the countless hours that have been consumed reporting &amp; replying to issues related to this.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>Always show 'codeSync' option - in sync-option in UI</strong> - <a href=""http://urls.greenkeeper.io/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/931"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/931"" data-id=""122414829"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#931</a> <a href=""http://urls.greenkeeper.io/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/802"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/issues/802"" data-id=""104645089"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#802</a> </li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>


<h1>Examples</h1>


<p>Below are a few examples showing what is now possible in 2.12.0</p>


<h2>Proxy - <code>proxyReq</code> &amp; <code>proxyRes</code>
</h2>


<div class=""highlight highlight-source-js""><pre>proxy<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> {
    target<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>http://www.bbc.co.uk<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>,
    <span class=""pl-c"">/**</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">     * Functions given here will be called with the proxy </span>
<span class=""pl-c"">     * request object *before* it hits your application</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">     */</span>
    proxyReq<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> [
        <span class=""pl-k"">function</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">proxyReq</span>) {
            <span class=""pl-smi"">proxyReq</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">setHeader</span>(<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">'</span>X-Special-Proxy-Header<span class=""pl-pds"">'</span></span>, <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">'</span>foobar<span class=""pl-pds"">'</span></span>);
        }
    ],
    <span class=""pl-c"">/**</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">     * Functions given here will be called with the response </span>
<span class=""pl-c"">     * object *before* it hits the browser</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">     */</span>
    proxyRes<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> [
        <span class=""pl-c"">/**</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">         * Here you have access to the raw response from your</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">         * application *before* it hits the browser</span>
<span class=""pl-c"">         */</span>
        <span class=""pl-k"">function</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">res</span>) {
            <span class=""pl-smi"">res</span>.<span class=""pl-c1"">headers</span>[<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">'</span>some-other-header<span class=""pl-pds"">'</span></span>] <span class=""pl-k"">=</span> <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">'</span>value<span class=""pl-pds"">'</span></span>;
        }
    ]
}</pre></div>


<h3>Middleware - applied on a per-route basis</h3>


<p><strong>Before</strong> - you needed to check the url manually</p>


<div class=""highlight highlight-source-js""><pre>middleware<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> [<span class=""pl-k"">function</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">req</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">res</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">next</span>) {
    <span class=""pl-k"">if</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">req</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">url</span>.<span class=""pl-c1"">match</span>(<span class=""pl-sr""><span class=""pl-pds"">/</span><span class=""pl-k"">^</span><span class=""pl-cce"">\/</span>api<span class=""pl-pds"">/</span></span>)) {
        <span class=""pl-c"">// some middleware logic</span>
    } <span class=""pl-k"">else</span> {
        <span class=""pl-en"">next</span>();
    }
}]</pre></div>


<p><strong>After</strong> - define the route up front</p>


<div class=""highlight highlight-source-js""><pre>middleware<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> [
    {
        route<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>/api<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>,
        <span class=""pl-en"">handle</span><span class=""pl-k"">:</span> <span class=""pl-k"">function</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">req</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">res</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">next</span>) {
            <span class=""pl-c"">// some middleware logic</span>
        }
    }
]</pre></div>


<p><strong>Mix and match</strong> - some middleware are global, some per-route. No problem. Here's an example where 2 global middleware apply to every route, and one applies to <code>/api</code> only</p>


<div class=""highlight highlight-source-js""><pre>middleware<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> [
    <span class=""pl-c1"">require</span>(<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>compression<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>)(), <span class=""pl-c"">// global gzip middleware</span>
    <span class=""pl-k"">function</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">req</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">res</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">next</span>) {
       <span class=""pl-c"">// some other generic middleware</span>
       <span class=""pl-en"">next</span>();
    },
    {
        route<span class=""pl-k"">:</span> <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>/api<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>, <span class=""pl-c"">// per-route</span>
        <span class=""pl-en"">handle</span><span class=""pl-k"">:</span> <span class=""pl-k"">function</span> (<span class=""pl-smi"">req</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">res</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">next</span>) {
            <span class=""pl-c"">// some middleware logic</span>
            <span class=""pl-c"">// like handing the request off to a proxy etc</span>
        }
    }
]</pre></div>

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/661,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/661,floreks,Refactor action bar and add breadcrumbs framework,"This has grown quite big. Sorry for that. I can move part that enables actionbar in the UI to different PR if needed.
## Important changes
- Refactored action bar
- Implemented simple breadcrumbs framework
### Actionbar

It is separated into 3 areas. Configurable area is defined per view and needs its own controller and template.

`[breadcrumbs (const width) | flex area | configurable (button) area ]`
### Breadcrumbs
- UI Router based
- Sets label that will be displayed instead of state name
- Sets parent state name without the need to define nested states
- Interpolates label name based on f.e. state params. This only works for the last state in chain for now to keep the implementation fairly simple.
- Limits breadcrumb chain lenght
- Supports middle ellipsis formatting for long breadcrumb labels

Example configuration:

``` javascript
'kdBreadcrumbs': {
  'label': '{{$stateParams.replicationController}}',
  'parent': 'replicationcontrollers',
},
```
### Other changes
- Added actionbar to RC list page
- Added actionbar to RC details page
- Supports responsive design
### Update 1:
- Removed sidebar header on RC details page
- Style changes
- Changed buttons to icons on actionbar
- **Tests in progress...**
### Update 2:
- Removed sidebar completely and enabled details tab
- Configured icons and added tooltips on actionbar
- Used angular components instead of directives
- Added tests

RC details page:

Basically, the validation works. Error message is shown, however, the elements below move down a few pixels when the error message appears. Not sure how to fix that.

I added a watch to run validation when port-mapping is changed. We have now 2 cyclic watches from port-mapping --> expose service and expose-service --> port-mapping. 

We could think about refactoring and move the expose service into the port mapping directive. In this case we could couple the logic stronger and remove the watches. Not sure if we want this.

@maciaszczykm please have a review

- `http://localhost:9091/api/v1/services/{namespace}/{service}` returns `{service}` service details from `{namespace}` namespace

Placed all logic in one file, it can change later, but at the moment I think it's not necessary.

I'm open to your suggestions as this is only proposal at the moment.

Tests need to be updated.

Used `.` for some local imports, it's not the best solution, but it didn't require much code refactoring. I will work on it.

There are methods which need to be moved to another files, files that should be renamed etc. I think we should work on it later and treat this pull request as a starting point.

Waiting for #673. Fixes #668.

I refactored the code, but I am not sure, is it good or for bad?

Positive: moving the expose service checkbox into the directive. 
Negative: removing the watch requires to add direct function calls at any place the model might be changed. There would be still one watch to be removed and the code would get even more complicated, I assume.

Somehow, I feel we are doing something wrong. 

IMHO, the best option is to keep the checkbox in the directive but add a watch again. Or we think about handling the validation differently?

@maciaszczykm  can you please have a look and tell me your opinion?

https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/680

Code is quite easy ( No watch was used). Test and clean up is missing. I will do it if you like the proposal.

@floreks I am interested if you like the usability and the look and feel. 

First option with header to indicate that both fields belong together. Similar to labels.
![expose-externally-redesign](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7448799/14954203/c8e2030c-1070-11e6-8669-44562425dce7.png)

Second option without header (I like better):

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/725,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/725,taimir,Improved localization through google getMsg(),"This is an improved version of my getMsg() proposal for the localization in dashboard. It differs from https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/528 in the following aspects:
- I tried to parallelize as much of the code as possible. Previously, the `build-frontend` was called once for each locale, which is an overkill. Now `build-frontend` is called only once and the result is then `multiDest`-ed into all the _arch_ x _locale_ directories.
- The localization is then achieved by replacing only the `app.js` files (instead of calling the whole `build-frontend` like before).
- The different localized versions of the `app.js` files are built via `gulp scripts:prod` into separate directories under `.tmp`. NOTE: I could not make this step parallel, because `gulp-closure-compiler` cannot be run in parallel. I know the exact point of failure, it is [here](https://github.com/steida/gulp-closure-compiler/blob/master/index.js#L125). Basically its an issue with the temporary file used to hold the output of the closure-compiler.
- Instead of using `merge-stream` and `async` like before, I now only use `multiDest` and standard gulp-tasks defined on the fly, which I execute with `run-sequence`. That way we have the benefit of no third party dependencies and we can directly see the actual tasks being executed in the console (with the nice gulp coloring, etc.).
- The `LocaleHandler` backend component now first compares the `Accept Language` header to a list of predefined locales before serving anything (security measure).

@bryk PTAL, I tried to improve upon all of your remarks. Do you think the LocaleHandler is now secure enough? What do we do with the `scripts:prod` task, I cannot run it in parallel because of the `gulp-closure-compiler`, but there is no way around calling it once for each locale.

I've also generified some selector matching functions and slightly rewritten `getNodePortEndpoints` function because there were too many nested loops. 

I'm thinking about common functions. Now there are many functions in `replicasetcommon` `servicecommon` etc., that are used by other packages. Common  functions in there should be package specific and we could have i.e. `common/pod.go` with global functions related to pods that can be used in all other packages.

With current design it's easy to fall into dependency cycle and some functions in common package like the one I've put in `types.go` do not always fit in their current place.

@bryk what do you think?

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/737,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/737,Seb-Solon,Add: flag.CommandLine.Parse at start for glog initialization,"Hi,

This pull request is a small fix to remove the following warning message in dashboard logs : 

```
ERROR: logging before flag.Parse: I0512 18:03:01.134758       1FILE:LINENO] Message
```

The errors comes when glog is called without being initialized. As the dashboard uses kubernetes, which uses glog, we have to add the flag.CommandLine.Parse(make([] string, 0)) line to initialize glog.

In our case the log line will just become : 

```
I0512 18:03:01.134758       1FILE:LINENO] Message
```

=> removed label kubernetes.io/cluster-servservice to prevent add-on manager to remove dashboard again. However, `kubectl cluster-info` will not list dashboard service

=> update readme to better fit to use case

Closes #826

I've added frontend pagination based on this module: https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination

It's very light, has support for async data and is easy to style. For now I've added central service that returns max number of rows to display on the list. I'm planning to extend that and add select box to every list where we can choose i.e. 10/25/50/100 items to show + some easy search box to filter data on the list.

Todo:
- [x] Add tests
- [ ] Add support to all resource lists

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-angular.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I tried finding a good target to link to in the documentation, but it seems as if the link had no target for a good reason: there is no content describing the event log or expiry of events, currently.

To avoid a dysfunctional link in the Dashboard I suggest removing it.

With this small change performance has increased about 3 times. I've used CPU profiling on chrome and JS profiling on firefox 47/40.
- On chrome `computeTextLength` function usage decreased from ~6.2% to ~1.8%
- On firefox 47 loading time of my workload page decreased from ~17s to ~8s. Other pages are loading instantly. On firefox 40 performance increase is similar, but it takes ~4.5s to load the page. It seems that newer the version of FF is, longer it takes to render the page. Unfortunately...
#### About changes

It will recalculate middle ellipsis only on first page load and on resize. This way it won't be fired on every digest loop. Dashboard seems to be more responsive now. Please test it also. It is only half measure, but for now should be sufficient.

Also thanks to registering it on `resize` event, I've fixed #691.
Partially fixes also #899

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-flatten.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-angular-templatecache.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/miickel/gulp-angular-templatecache/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

<p>In this release we replace <code>js-string-escape</code> with <code>jsesc</code>, which handles the string escaping more efficiently by avoiding unnecessary escape characters (quotes).</p>


<p>This change is breaking, as from now on we only support Node versions &gt;= 4.2 (previously 0.8). For older versions of Node, please revert back to using <code>v1.9.1</code> of this plugin.</p>

One thing I don't like is that on namespace change when there is nothing to display it will redirect to zerostate, but then after switching back to namespace with resources we have to click logo to be redirected to workloads page.

Probably namespace change event should be modified, so if current state is zerostate then try to reach last known page or workloads page.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-core.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>


<ul>
<li>context: Our <code>context.html</code> and <code>debug.html</code> structures have changed to lean on <code>context.js</code> and <code>debug.js</code>.
This is in preparation for deeper <code>context.js</code> changes in <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/karma-runner/karma/pull/1984"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/1984"" data-id=""140106835"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#1984</a>.</li>

The `kind: list` thingy doesn't work here, as it has problems with using `extensions/v1beta1` so I used `---` to make a valid YAML list.

Other than that nothing has changed. The selector had to be slightly modified to include `matchLabels:`.

I've tested this already, and it works for me.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-angular.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Not to be merged. FYI only. @maciaszczykm, @floreks, @bryk 

I tried make a couple of changes that will be required for Hyperkube 1.3.  Unfortunately, I was not able to fix travis.

I have currently no idea how I could debug travis easily. Not applying the changes has the following consequences after 1.3:
- The included dashboard of hyperkube will crash during start-up
- Sky-dns will crash during start up

Both are not too important for us, currently. Maybe we fix later

As npm-check-updates is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

#### Backend
- Added pagination support
- Adjusted pod list to support pagination mechanism
- Introduced `MetaList` object and added to all resource lists. For now it contains information about total number of items on the list. Used for pagination.
- Unified most of API responses to return resource lists instead of array of resources
- Added partial support for daemon set events. Related to #991. Still needs some work to get events. For now I've adjusted it so there won't be any errors in frontend.
#### Frontend
- Redesigned resource card pagination component.
- Adjusted all resource card lists to accept resource lists instead of array of resources. Needed for correct pagination support.
- ~~Added JQuery instead of JQLite due to [this change](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/993/files#diff-d9db95a2e080e0a38da22ca5d3183b9eR43). `ng-attr-xxx` uses JQuery to remove attr from element if condition is not met. Without JQuery there was console error saying that `element.remove...` function does not exist.~~

In order to use server side pagination resource card list needs list of objects and list factory that will return new portion of objects on page change. If list factory is not provided frontend pagination will be applied. That's why for now only pod list page and pods on workloads page support pagination. I will extend it to other resources in next PRs as it requires further backend API changes.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Also I've added new endpoints in order to support pagination of related resources.

New style assumes that all related resources on detail pages will be exposed using following style:
`api/v1/<resource>/<namespace>/<resourceName>/<relatedResource>`

Newly exposed endpoints:
`api/v1/replicationcontroller/<namespace>/<resourceName>/pod`
`api/v1/replicationcontroller/<namespace>/<resourceName>/event`
`api/v1/replicationcontroller/<namespace>/<resourceName>/service`

Pagination support will be added in next PR.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As npm-check-updates is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

1. Is Dashboard okay with depending on this library? (not one I have experience with, just the first one Google gave me)
2. Is there a better way to load the library than src'ing it from the index page?
3. Should we mirror it somewhere instead of relying on rawgit?
4. Trusting all log output as safe HTML to be injected into the page probably isn't very smart, does Angular provide a better way to handle this?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As html-minifier is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>errors:</strong> emit errors of type <code>GulpUglifyError</code> (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/commit/1232c3c"">1232c3c</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>minifer:</strong> use <code>gulplog</code> for the warning (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/commit/5632cee"">5632cee</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Features</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>minifier:</strong> use UglifyJS 2.7.0's input map support (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/commit/8160697"">8160697</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>


<ul>
<li>errors: Emitted errors are of a new type. Original UglifyJS
error message are preserved instead of the attempt to normalize them.
The constructor is exported as ""GulpUglifyError"" to allow for instance
checks.</li>
<li>minifier: Now requires UglifyJS 2.7.0 or greater to use the
input object support.</li>
</ul>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of file-exists.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Supports most resources, new resources easy to add. Can perform
automatic aggregation of the data.
### Usage Example

To get memory and cpu usage from all pods in kube-system and default namespaces you can use:
http://0.0.0.0:9090/api/v1/graph?metrics=cpu/usage_rate,memory/usage&namespaces=kube-system,default&pods=

And to aggregate this data:
http://0.0.0.0:9090/api/v1/graph?metrics=cpu/usage_rate,memory/usage&namespaces=kube-system,default&pods=&aggregate=sum

Similarly, to get and aggregate all memory and cpu consumption of few deployments (ie. all their pods):
http://0.0.0.0:9090/api/v1/graph?metrics=cpu/usage_rate,memory/usage&namespaces=some_namespace&deployments=deployment1,deployment2&aggregate=sum

Note: you have to comment out both `--heapster-host=` lines inside build/serve.js  to enable heapster metrics.

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/1098,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/1098,PiotrDabkowski,Added backend sort support to all resources,"Added DataSelectQuery object which contains data selection instruction. Instructions currently only include pagination and sort options, but this can be easy extended to contain also filter options etc. 

DataSelectQuery works tightly with GenericDataSelect function which can perform data selection (according to options present in DataSelectQuery) on any data list composing of GenericDataCells.

I implemented GenericDataCell interface for every resource present in the dashboard and therefore any resource can be now selected according to DataSelect instructions (it is pagination and sorting as for now). Adding filtering will require minimal effort so if needed I can also add data filtering.
### Functionality

Currently data can be sorted by following parameters: name, creationTimestamp, namespace. Please let me know if you want me to add more sortable parameters. For example, adding IP sort for pods is the matter of adding one line of code to the propertyGetters of GenericPod. 
### Example Usage:

To sort pods by creationTimestamp (descending) and later by name (ascending) for pods with the same creation timestamp you can use following query:

http://0.0.0.0:9090/api/v1/pod?itemsPerPage=10&page=1&sortby=d,creationTimestamp,a,name

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As babel-preset-es2015 is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

It looked like job.Spec.Completions was being referenced for the job, although it was never set.

This PR adds a test case and a fix for the case when Completions is not set, and remains nil.

1. I assume the base image of travis was upgraded. The manual docker installation is no longer needed.
2. There seems to be additional bower caching problems. I have cleaned cache and passed this problem.

There is one issue left ""Error: Govendor is not on the path."" Not sure. I leaf office now. Feel free to merge - better than before

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As del is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of clang-format.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-core.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of clang-format.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Changes:
- [x] Change primary navigation item height from 40px to 44px
- [x] Add 8px top padding to side nav content
- [x] Add 32px bottom padding to the last object in side nav
- [x] **Namespace**: Change dropdown arrow opacity to .54 and align to the edge of underline
- [x] **Namespace**: Change dropdown arrow left margin to 24px
- [x] **Namespace**: Change font to Roboto Mono Medium
- [x] **Namespace**: Change dropdown bottom border focus color from blue to gray (Should selection indication be completely removed?)
- [x] Change breadcrumbs font to Roboto Medium 18px
- [x] Change app bar height from 64px to 56px
- [x] Change kubernetes text to SVG logo

Needs clarification:
- [x] Material icon called keyboard arrow right should be used between levels of hierarchy rather than the > character (is it arrow between breadcrumbs?)
- [ ] **Namespace**: Remove default dropdown dialogue selection from item (could be hard as it's default angular material behavior)
- [ ] **Namespace**: Change height to 32px height (namespace text or namespace selector?)
- [ ] **Namespace**: Change bottom border spacing to 10px away from the text (could be hard as it's default spacing of `border-bottom` and `border-spacing` doesn't work here)

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of browser-sync.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync/releases/tag/v2.16.0)

<p>2 fixes &amp; a really useful new option.</p>


<hr>

<ul class=""contains-task-list"">
<li class=""task-list-item"">
<input type=""checkbox"" class=""task-list-item-checkbox"" checked disabled> <strong>FIXED</strong> - current connections will show once again in the UI - <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/BrowserSync/UI/commit/00af3dac9ae4f5ea2fab456687063a87c50e9bf1"" class=""commit-link"">BrowserSync/UI@<tt>00af3da</tt></a>
</li>
</ul>


<hr>

<ul class=""contains-task-list"">
<li class=""task-list-item"">
<p><input type=""checkbox"" class=""task-list-item-checkbox"" checked disabled> <strong>FIXED</strong> - the version number of the Browsersync client script is now added as a query param instead of within the file path. This is a massive help for users that have the snippet saved in a file. </p>

<p>Fun fact: other than a sanity check to show which release of Browsersync you're using, the version number actually serves no purpose, and that's why:</p>
</li>
</ul>


<ol>
<li>it should've never been part of the the path in the first place as it caused problems for people upgrading</li>
<li>you've always been able to access the JS file <em>without</em> the version number at the end, but this wasn't the default... so no one did it... so I've fixed it now instead <g-emoji alias=""+1"" fallback-src=""https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png"">👍</g-emoji> </li>
</ol>


<hr>

<ul class=""contains-task-list"">
<li class=""task-list-item"">
<p><input type=""checkbox"" class=""task-list-item-checkbox"" checked disabled> <strong>ADDED</strong> - new option <code>cors: true</code> - setting this will ensure that <strong>all assets</strong> served by Browsersync (including the script file itself) in <strong>all</strong> modes will have HTTP access control headers added. </p>

<p>This allows any domain to access your files, which can lead to some creative workflows - for example, you could create a chrome extension that added some files you have locally into a live site &amp; have Browsersync auto-update them when they change.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<hr>

<p>enjoy :)</p>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of lodash.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to get full list of events due to event compression - we can only get cumulative event counts. Nevertheless this pull request contains useful code demonstrating how event timeline could be implemented.  It also contains code that helps to understand how to add custom features to the graph.

Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-htmlmin.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-core.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As browser-sync is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/1332,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/1332,nicr9,[WIP] helm dashboard integration,"Hey dashboard guys and gals,

Myself and @joe2far were quite taken with helm's issue for dashboard support: kubernetes/helm#990

We mentioned it to our bosses at [Ammeon](https://github.com/ammeon) and they were similarly excited! In fact they wanted us to mock up a prototype for a recent client demo.

As we were under a tight deadline we hammered together the following changes under the principle of ""it only matters if the user will see it"". We obviously have a long way to go before it's ready to touch master (the changes currently expect that tiller will always be available) but now that we're no longer operating under a deadline we'd like to start a discussion with yourselves (and the helm guys as well).

We're open to all suggestions for refactoring/improvement, please be kind though - our angular experience is minimal.

Here's some screenshots:

![](http://i.imgur.com/ua5HqLl.jpg)
![](http://i.imgur.com/ubM07nN.jpg)

Also, here's a [demo video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwsH9arFx6LBTmx3eDhfX19vWHc)

**Open design questions for interested parties:**
- [ ] Think of a suitable way to store/configure available helm repositories
- [ ] Ability to provide template values for chart at deploy-time
- [ ] How to handle upgrading releases when a newer chart is available?
- [ ] Deleting releases from dashboard
- [ ] What would it mean to edit a release from the dashboard? If this doesn't make sense, remove the option
- [ ] When looking up a specific release's details, how do you specify a namespace? Is it necessary?
- [ ] Learn about ListMeta, ObjectMeta and TypeMeta. Should they be added to the Release types for other dashboard functionality?

**Here's a list of the changes/improvements that we still aim to make:**
- [ ] Link ""Releases"" in side panel to Releases-specific list page
- [ ] ReleaseList should include failed/broken releases with a coloured icon and warning message in a tooltip
- [ ] Make sure that there's logic for hiding helm related stuff when `helmClient == nil` 
- [ ] Clean up the definitions of types in `externs/backendapi.js`
- [ ] Make sure all annotations are accurate and include a comment
- [ ] More robust error checking
- [ ] Is `ReleaseDetail` type needed?

We've pushed the latest build of our dashboard image to docker.io/ammeon/kubernetes-helm-dashboard-amd64:0.0.13

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of async.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of async.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-sourcemaps.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-sass-lint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

## Changes

 - Updated kubernetes dependencies to newest version
 - Refactored code to use newest clientset/interface
 - Renamed PetSet to StatefulSet
 - Disabled some backend tests due to unsupported code (they have to be rewritten)

For now [internalclient](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/client/clientset_generated/internalclientset) is used due to major differences between types when `client-go` is used. I have different branch with `client-go` integration but there are still many conflicts and it requires much more changes than using `internalclientset`. We can wait for `client-go` to use same types as main repo and then do the migration.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As browser-sync is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of html-minifier.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As babel-loader is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Currently it's only an echo server connected to an xterm.js frontend over websockets. Currently, doesn't work in development mode because browserSync doesn't support websockets.

Steps to test:
1. Run `gulp serve:prod`
1. View a pod detail page.
1. Click on the ""Exec"" link under a container card

Current issues
- Need to figure out how to create a remote command client since it's separate from the normal API client.
- Browsersync doesn't support websockets. Need to figure out a workaround.

- Currently it is implemented only for replication controller list and node list but can be used for every other resources and views.
- It is not complete yet. 
- It requires improvement and discussion before further development if it is needed at all. 

Auto-refresh feature is added to desired list or detail page as a directive with parameters of data resource delay and etc. It can be also used as a service but it has some pros and cons. 

It is based on polling action in particular intervals for retrieving data from back-end. 

Auto-refresh service automatically stops when user changes the states to avoid unnecessary polling unrelated to the selected view. It also breaks if any pop up menu is open to avoid disappearing menus involuntarily on update and it continues polling after the pop up menu closes. 

Multiple polling is possible for one view also with different delays. 

The graph component wasn't suitable for auto-refresh, therefore I made some small changes there to enable it.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

As merge-stream is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Raw metrics are available at /metrics

I tried keep the format similar to k8s-apiserver, but I had two problems:
1. I could not distinguish between Get and List easily. So everything is GET or PUT
2. I could not describe the resource properly in all cases. 

Of course, both aspects could be achieved by cluttering the dashboard-apihandler a bit. Maybe there is another clever option.

So, overall the metrics are not as precise as for kubernetes apiserver. Unless someone has clever idea, I would suggest to start with current solution and improve later on.

Some code changes to consider:
1. I added a dependency to k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/util/net. The utility method is not of much use. I can copy or remove if we try to get rid of k8s dependency.
2. I wanted to add a simple test for the metrics collection. Basically check that no error is thrown. And verify that metric reached prometheus. However, I could not read from prometheus. Suggestion welcome...

BTW: after this is merged we should instrument more code. E.g. I would suggest to _consider_ adding metrics at places we make debug output.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of clang-format.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-core.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This can be used together with a reverse proxy in front of the dashboard (e.g. [lua-resty-openidc](https://github.com/pingidentity/lua-resty-openidc)) to handle the actual authentication flow.

This is a work-in-progress. And the following still needs to be done:
- DeployAppFromFile expects a ClientConfig object instead of an actual ApiClient
- Cache API Clients per unqiue bearer token
- The dashboard still needs access to the api server on start to fetch the server version

Implementing an authentication flow inside the dashboard would be out of scope for this PR.

I would be happy to hear your comments, especially because I saw that handling IAM is already on the roadmap.","['floreks', 'maciaszczykm']",15,2016-12-23 16:51:33,2017-05-11 10:01:00,2017-05-11 10:01:00,True,2017-05-11 10:01:00,floreks,unknown,,closed

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-angular.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of browserify.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of html-minifier.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As npm-check-updates is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of file-exists.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

## What's done

- Client-go - updated to current master, commit hash: [86a2be1b447d7abddae88de0a5f642935992b803](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/86a2be1b447d7abddae88de0a5f642935992b803)
- 90% of the code migrated to use client-go instead of kubernetes deps
- Fixed most backend tests
- **Cleaned up kubernetes dependencies. Left only the one needed for deploy from file (kubectl utils) and updated, commit hash: 871fc426b3576bfe9a92b3ca1d4bfa83ea71edd5**

## TODO

- [x] ~Get rid of kubernetes dependencies~
- [x] Fix 10 tests that are skipped
- [x] Fix deployment detail and not use deployment utils from kubernetes
- [x] Fix deployment deploy not to use kubectl utils
- [x] Enable endpoint for getting deployments old replica sets

~Dashboard is running and travis should be green, however 1 endpoint is disabled and 10 tests are skipped.~

~In order to get rid of kubernetes as dependency and fully migrate to client-go we'd need to rewrite some code. Rewriting deployment details and getting replica sets should not be hard but getting rid of kubectl as dependency might be harder. If we want to do that then I will create issues for that.~

~I have not updated kubernetes dependencies because current master and 1.6.0-alpha are broken. Same dependency error as in [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/93).~

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As npm-check-updates is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Small patch - still I need some help :)

Question 1: In which step should I patch the source files?

In my understanding I have to options:
1: build/script.js
2: build/build.js somewhere at localize task

Both options are possible. I just wonder which version is cleaner and more obvious

- In script.js I could limit the replace scope to a single source file. In build.js the source files are concatenated  already to multiple app.js files. So the patch must run over the full files. 
- the localize task seems simpler to refactor to make the patching more explicit in the code

Question 2: should I reuse existing configuration service or create new one?

Existing services:
1: index_config.js
2. appconfig_service.js

or new one

Any preference?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of clang-format.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-preset-es2015.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As html-minifier is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-angular.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-angular.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/1792,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/1792,floreks,Add support for sorting and fix minor issues,"It required some major changes in frontend. Currently sorting is supported for 3 types of columns: name, status and age. 

In order to add support for sorting to the existing list open the cardlist.html template and add i.e.: `sortable=""true""` and `sord-id=$root.SortableProperties.NAME` to the `kd-resource-card-header-column` representing name column. It will enable sorting for this column and use corresponding backend method for sorting.

## Important changes
 - Created `DataSelectService` instead of `PaginationService` that handles all kinds of data selection, including: sorting, filtering, paging. Currently sorting and paging is implemented.
 - Moved `list`, `list-resource` and `data-select-id` dependency from `kd-resource-card-list-pagination` to `kd-resource-card-list`. It will be shared with child components thanks to parent - child relationship between components.
 - Moved data select ids to corresponding component controller `getSelectId` method. In case if it's empty, data select logic will not be applied to the list.
 - By default all resources will be sorted by age in the ascending order. From youngest to oldest one.
 - In order to share supported SortableProperties I have added run config to DataSelect module and injected them into the rootScope that is by default available in all templates by executing `$root.SortableProperties.NAME`. I'm not sure if there is a better way to do that. They are const values so there should be no risk with exposing them in root scope.

## Additional changes
 - Add missing graph cards to cluster view.
 - Update closure compiler externs to version 1.6
 - Enable console log usage in karma tests
 - Add missing externs to `backendapi.js`
 - Update `foreground-3` css variable to match material design spec

In order to change that we've had to change build files. I have changed that to first check environment variables, then use predefined ones.

This allows to easily configure build pipeline to use external cluster for `serve` and `serve:prod`, i.e. I'm using kubeconfig env variable to connect to minikube cluster that by default is secured and does not expose insecure api server port.

Environment variables:
 - `KUBE_DASHBOARD_APISERVER_HOST` - do `export KUBE_DASHBOARD_APISERVER_HOST=<HOST>` to override default api server url
 - `KUBE_DASHBOARD_KUBECONFIG` - do `export KUBE_DASHBOARD_KUBECONFIG=<PATH>` to use kubeconfig file instead of api server host param. Kubeconfig env variable has higher priority than apiserver host.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of browserify.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

 - Update backend documentation

 - Clean up horizontal pod autoscalers frontend code to correctly support sorting
 - Disable sorting in case list resource is not provided instead of throwing an error

Last change is done due to i.e. deployment's new replica sets not having it's own endpoint for updates. As there is always only one new replica set and we are using list to display it I am not sure if having separate endpoint is good. We don't need sorting nor paging on such lists so we can disable it instead of throwing an error.

1. start container:
`docker run --rm -ti -p 9090:9090 gcr.io/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-amd64:v1.6.0 --apiserver-host=http://192.168.0.10:8080 `

2. click ""Create"" and upload a yaml.

3. the server crashed, and error like below:
```
Using apiserver-host location: http://localhost:8080
Creating API server client for http://localhost:8080
Error while initializing connection to Kubernetes apiserver. This most likely means that the cluster is misconfigured (e.g., it has invalid apiserver certificates or service accounts configuration) or the
 --apiserver-host param points to a server that does not exist. Reason: Get http://localhost:8080/version: dial tcp [::1]:8080: getsockopt: connection refused

## what I do
according to https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/1739 , I just modify the deploy part.

## how to check
`gulp serve` to check first, and then `gulp docker-image:release:cross` build image and run container to check again.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

## Changes
 - Introduced error localization mechanism
 - Fixed #1374

## TODO
 - [x] Clean up the code

## Error localizer
I have introduced a mechanism to localize messages coming from backend. Basically it is based on 2 maps that have to be synchronized on backend and frontend side.

`backend[partial -> code] -> frontend[code -> msg]`

Backend map structure:
 - key: unique partial string used to differentate message coming from api server. Some errors have their own api and are exposed as const objects so we can also use them.
 - value: unique error code string that can be recognized by frontend and used for localization

Frontend map structure:
 - key: basically it is backend's map value
 - value: message localized with `goog.getMsg`.

Additionally I have created `LocalizerService` that will take error string and localize it or return original string if it is not recognized.

## Main fix description
Basically we have 5 cases to consider (i'm assuming that namespace is always correct and exists):

1. Namespace is set in both file and dashboard and
   1. they are equal - **OK**
   1. they are different - **NOK** error is thrown that there is namespace mismatch between dashboard and yaml file.
1. Namespace is set in file and all namespaces are set in dashboard - **OK**
1. Namespace is set in dashboard but not set in file - **OK**
1. No namespace in both file and dashboard (all namespaces) - **NOK** error is thrown that namespace is not selected in both file and in dashboard

Hello lovely humans,

[jsesc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsesc) just published its new version 2.5.1.

  </tr>
</table>

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As jsesc is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma-chrome-launcher.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This is building on code/ideas/comments from #1455 and #1345, so some of the problems/suggestions mentioned there are addressed.

Task list:
- [x] Builds prod
- [x] You can actually execute a shell and get a terminal in the containers
- [x] Support trying different shells (tries `bash` than `sh` for now)
- [x] Using hterm. So copy-paste, colors, mouse, etc.
- [x] Resizing
- [x] Moon buggy!!
- [x] Message on disconnect
- [x] SockJS transport (kubectl proxy does not support websockets (kubernetes/kubernetes#32026) which is a major use case. So if websockets do not work it falls back on different kinds of http streaming. It is jerkier and much less efficient than websockets but at least it works.)
- [ ] Ability to attach as in kubectl attach
- [x] Come up with a better name than ""Attach"" for the shell exec link
- [x] Make code look not horrible. For example, find better names for all the `*attach*` functions and structures. Dependencies for gorilla/websocket should be removed.
- [ ] Implement locking for session map (while the current code is _bad_, actually triggering the problem is unlikely)
- [ ] Add links leading to exec view (something like logs button)
- [ ] Serve `SockJSURL` from dashboard
- [ ] utf-8 _input_ (needs hterm needs configuration)
- [ ] Add some tests
- [ ] Some solution to respawn if the user exits the shell (?)
- [ ] Some padding on the left (?)

</table>

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As js-beautify is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

[browser-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync) just published its new version 2.18.9.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As browser-sync is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I have prepared client manager that is responsible for creating client on every request, generating csrfKey, handling auth, etc.

There are many files changed as I've had to move some general types to single directory. They are now under `api/types.go`. We could think of moving all our api structures that we have in `backendapi.js` there.

### Key files changed/moved
`apihandler.go` - moved code to other files
`apiserverclient.go` - removed and some code moved to `client/manager.go`
`heapsterclient.go` moved to `integration/metric/heapster/client.go` as that's where I keep on my branch where I'm working on integrations page.
`filter.go` - contains filter methods that were in `apihandler.go` before
`verber.go` moved to `client/verber.go` as it is also a client and is created by `ClientManager`

Changes in other files are renaming old packages to new ones. I have tested external config, in-cluster config and auth header and it works.

I have decided to take care of config storage and sync in next PRs as this will be already a big change. Any comments are appreciated.

## Major changes
 - Added `IntegrationManager` that will be responsible for providing state of integration app (installed, connected, enabled, etc.) and listing all integrations. 
- Added `MetricManager` as a dependency of `IntegrationManager`. It represents group of metric integrations like heapster, prometheus, etc. It will be responsible for controlling status of all metric integrations and providing active metric client.
- Added `MetricClient` interface as a layer of abstraction between resources and metric api. All metric integrations will have to implement that interface.
- Removed all hard dependencies on heapster from our sources and replaced them with `MetricClient`.

Rules for introducing new integration would be:
1. Implement `Integration` interface to make sure that every integration app has unique ID and can do a health check to make sure if we can enable it.
1. Introduce new group-like interface that will be responsible for handling new integration. I'm thinking about adding interface similar to `Integration` that will make sure that every 'group' can handle integrations, i.e. install/uninstall or enable/disable them.

Later on they should support storage thus implement necessary methods that will make sure that state of integrations is persisted and up to date.

There is a check now if rbac api group is enabled and its' version is supported by dashboard.
As kubernetes 1.6 added `v1beta1` version then this is what we'll support. In case some older version is enabled or RBACs are disabled menu entry will be hidden.

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for dashboard :muscle:



This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point. I will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, **as soon as you merge this pull request**.

**I won’t start sending you further updates, unless you have merged this very pull request**.



---
<details>
<summary>💥 This branch failed. How to proceed</summary>

I suggest you find out what dependency update is causing the problem. Adapt your code so things are working nicely together again. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Push the changes to this branch and merge it.

<details>
<summary>🏷 How to check the status of this repository</summary>

There is a badge added to your README, indicating the status of this repository.

This is how your badge looks like :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kubernetes/dashboard.svg)
</details>
<details>
<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just [change the `package.json` file back to your liking](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

Add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update right now.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # adapt your code, so it’s working again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push origin greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How the updates will look like</summary>

As soon as you merge this pull request **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I’ll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

First we have to state what we will support. What I think we should do is:

1. Provide good documentation for latest supported kubernetes release (currently 1.6).
1. Provide option to deploy on older clusters but leave advanced configuration up to the users. Only basic yaml without RBAC configuration.
1. Split deployment into 2 parts: dashboard, rbac configuration
1. Document details about single/multi tenant approach that our proposed configuration supports.
1. For multi-tenant setup describe how to authorize users using authorization header and tokens but without specific examples as we don't have enough people to maintain them well.
1. Simplify head releases and support only latest kubernetes versions with full access to the cluster (by providing yaml file). Of course we will add information about that to warn potential users.
1. Remove other arch yaml files and just document what architectures we support with example that in order to deploy for different arch user can use this command `curl -sSL <dashboard_url> | sed ""s/amd64/arm64/g"" | kubectl create -f -`
1. State that `kubectl proxy` is not the right way to authorize users for multi-tenant configurations.

I have updated documentation a bit and if we agree on required changes I will update yamls and remaining docs.

Calling everyone involved in discussion.

- Every resource list structure now have `list of non-critical errors, that occurred during resource retrieval`. It allows to silence these errors and avoid whole page crash. We will show these errors as a popup warnings to the user. It is needed to allow users without all privileges to search or users without privilege to see secrets to access pods page (see related issues below).
- `HandleError()` function was introduced. It distinguishes critical errors from non-critical ones. In the future `HandleErrors()` should be introduced too (it should work with multiple errors on input. Also methods to append errors to existing structures may be needed. It keeps code changes at the minimum.
- All non-critical errors are be logged. In the future popups on the frontend have to be added.
- **Refactored all resources list and detail pages to use new error handling.**

## Changes
 - Fix warning events display on list/detail pages (often there was just a pod with pending icon shown)
 - Adapt events behavior to kubectl. In short kubectl only displays events related to a resource and other events are shown for pods. 
 - Fix creator feature for Jobs. Currently we show `Created by` list and annotation with link on pod detail page even if pod is not targeting correct Job. They should be matched by label `uid-controller` set on both Pod and Job during creation.
 - Fix bug where pod info was not displayed correctly on Job list page due to wrong filtering of matching pods.
 - Refactor the way we get events and remove dead code.

The version **20170626.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

As you probably noticed it removes bottom border from the card, but it is almost not visible since we are using box shadows for every card and when there are no footer we have one border anyways.

Often when looking at the main dashboard page, users on my team want to see all of the objects associated with a particular namespace. **Currently it is only possible to see objects in the groups ""Workloads"", ""Discovery and Load Balancing"", and ""Config and Storage"".** This PR implements a button on the left sidebar that shows all the resources under those fields at the same time.

## Backend
A `/overview/` endpoint has been added to the api. The endpoint returns all of the objects included in ""Workloads"", ""Discovery and Load Balancing"", and ""Config and Storage"" for a given namespace.

A new endpoint was created to be in keeping with the convention for ""Workloads"", ""Discovery"" etc. which all have their own endpoints. The `/search/` endpoint does something similar to `/overview/`, but it is not namespace specific.

The version **5.4.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of semver.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Often when looking at the main dashboard page, users on my team want to see all of the objects associated with a particular namespace. **Currently it is only possible to see objects in the groups ""Workloads"", ""Discovery and Load Balancing"", and ""Config and Storage"".** This PR implements a button on the left sidebar that shows all the resources under those fields at the same time. This is my first pull request on the dashboard project and I am eager for suggestions and feedback! Please let me know if this diff is too big and I can submit the backend and frontend PRs separately.

## Backend
A `/overview/` endpoint has been added to the api. The endpoint returns all of the objects included in ""Workloads"", ""Discovery and Load Balancing"", and ""Config and Storage"" for a given namespace.

A new endpoint was created to be in keeping with the convention for ""Workloads"", ""Discovery"" etc. which all have their own endpoints. The `/search/` endpoint does something similar to `/overview/`, but it is not namespace specific.

## Frontend
The frontend component is implemented using the `workloads` component as a guide. When allobjects is clicked, it hits the `/overview/` endpoint and pulls the desired resources.

Closes #2093.

This PR adds basic login functionality to dashboard. There are still many things to improve but after this initial version will be merged we will be able to split the work. It is based on [JSON Web Encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516) (JWE) standard.

### Data flow
Dashboard will generate encryption key during the start and it will be stored in a secret accessible by dashboard (not yet implemented).

1. User opens dashboard
1. Token is not present in a cookie and authorization header is not passed to dashboard
1. User fills in token field and clicks on login button
1. LoginSpec is sent to the backend (we'll make it work only over HTTPS)
1. Backend gets encryption key from a secret.
1. Token is taken and basic health check is made to see if it is recognized by apiserver.
1. Auth structure is encrypted and sent back to the frontend.
1. Frontend stores encrypted token in a cookie and user is redirected to the default state.
1. Cookie is passed to the backend on every request, decrypted there and auth info is used to create client.

This is the basic flow. In case authorization header is sent to the dashboard it will override our log in mechanism and will be used instead.

## Changes
 - Added angular cookies.
 - Added login page and made it independent of chrome state.
 - Added new transition/request hooks to redirect user to login page in case he is not logged in.
 - Added support for token based log in.
 - Adapted nav bar to be able to correctly show/hide it during initial page load. Before that nav component settings were overriding other components so I have moved logic to the nav service.
 - Added `go-jose` as a dependency for managing JWE tokens.

## Current limitations
 - Only token based login is supported
 - Encryption key is generated on backend. Backend crash means that stored token will be invalid
 - Because of previous issue dashboard can not be scaled

## Improvements
List of things to improve will be tracked from #2207.

## TODO
List of things to be done before the merge.

 - [x] Add JSDoc
 - [x] Add documentation
 - [x] Remove hardcoded strings (state, token name, etc.)
 - [x] Refactor the code
 - [x] Add tests
 - [x] Test on serve:prod
 
## UX
We'll rework it after everything is stable. For now it's very simple. There was also basic login option but I have disabled it for now due to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/49709.

## Changes
 - Added secret synchronizer that is mainly responsible for watching on a single resource changes.
 - Added encryption key import/export option in order to be able to save it in a secret. Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/a/44688503.
 - Adapted token manager to use key holder which uses secret synchronizer in order to import/export encryption key.
 - Added `Overwatch` that is started automatically with backend and is responsible for starting and watching over every registered synchronizer. Every synchronizer with restart policy `Always` will be restarted in case of error.

## TODO
 - [x] Refactor code
 - [x] Add documentation
 - [x] Add tests

Backend will always generate encryption key on start and try to push it to a secret. After it is created synchronizer basically watches for secret updates. On every update, handler registered by key holder is fired and encryption key is updated. As all backends will always be watching for the same resource, key from last event will be used.

In case of decryption error we can always force single update from secret and try once again.

The version **4.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-stream.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-core.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Updated manually `google-closure-compiler` and `webpack-stream` to latest versions.

## Important changes
 - Module resolution `LEGACY` has been removed from `google-closure-compiler`. I have changed it to `NODE` and fixed all errors and warnings.
 - Updated ECMAScript preset to `env` which contains all features from ES2015 together with new features from ES2016 and ES2017. We'll be slowly migrating to use new [async and await](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-to-generator/) syntax and more. 
 - Updated closure compiler input language to `ECMASCRIPT_2017`.
 - Updated `webpack` configuration to match webpack 3.
 - Updated minor versions of other dependencies, i.e. angular to `1.6.6`
 - Reenabled compiler check `analyzerChecks`.

### **NOTE: All our imports have to start with `/`, `./` or `../` now, however I'd prefer to use options 2 and 3.**

### Changes
 - Added `--tokenTTL` argument to dashboard.
 - Default token expiration time has been set to 15 minutes
 - Token is refreshed with every state change in dashboard
 - In case token has expired user will be automatically redirected to login page with information that `Session expired. Please log in again.` Same behaviour is applied in case token can not be decrypted.

### TODO
 - [x] Handle token expiration error (it should logout user and redirect to login state)
 - [x] Add tests

The version **1.0.54** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of clang-format.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **1.7.1** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

### Changes
- Add `--authentication-mode` flag to dashboard. Supported options are: `token`, `basic`. Default: `token`.
- Add kubeconfig based login option. It is automatically enabled in case any auth mode is enabled.
- Add more generic upload directive. Deploy should use this one. We should rewrite it eventually.

Right now all errors returned by backend are forwarded and displayed on login screen in warning popup.

### TODO
- [x] Add documentation
- [x] Add tests

Unfortunately, there is no clean way to do it, because:

-  `md-tooltip` element disappears from HTML just after compiling so custom attribute directive won't work
- wrapping `md-tooltip` in our component is also not an option because tooltip works only on the parent element and it this case it would be our new component (we cannot use replace when transcluding because it is deprecated)
- overriding `md-tooltip` to make it use our defaults is also not possible due to component original implementation
- copying `md-tooltip` to our code base is also not a good option

Therefore, I've changed fixed all occurences of `md-tooltip` in our codebase to:

``` html
<md-tooltip md-delay=""500"" md-autohide>
   ...
</md-tooltip>
```

The version **20170910.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/2363,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/2363,floreks,Fix minor issues and update deploy files,"## Changes
- Change text `log in` to `sign in`.
- Fix overwatch not restarting synchronizer in case of missing watch permissions for secret.
- Fix issue with accessing pod details page when user had no access to creator of the pod.
- Update and remove unused head yaml files to match 1.7 release requirements.

As for the last change, I believe that starting from 1.7 we should only support secure setup of Dashboard. This means that in case user has a cluster with authorization and authentication disabled he has to prepare yaml file on his own. 

Right now I have granted minimal privileges to dashboard required to start and run without issues.
- `create` and `watch` permission for secrets in `kube-system` namespace in order to create and watch for changes of `kubernetes-dashboard-key-holder` secret.

The version **4.3.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-inject.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Profiling `dashboard` binary showed function that caused high CPU usage.

```

Compared to other functions, goroutine started in `secretSynchronizer.Start` method took most CPU time.
```golang
for {
	select {
	case ev, ok := <-watcher.ResultChan():
		if err := self.handleEvent(ev); err != nil {
			self.errChan <- err
			return
		}
	}
}
```

The problem was that after some time kubernetes watcher times out without any reason and `ResultChan` is closed. That caused infinite `for` loop. Given that it was running in another goroutine, dashboard was still responsive.

## Fix
Simple check if channel was closed did the trick.
```golang
case ev, ok := <-watcher.ResultChan():
	if !ok {
		self.errChan <- fmt.Errorf(""%s watch ended with timeout"", self.Name())
		return
	}

The version **2.13.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **1.7.4** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of js-beautify.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **3.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of browserify-istanbul.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

## Changes
- Fix visual bug with moving select menu to the top of the page when there were many namespaces and last one was selected.
- Add input field to the top of the namespace select menu. After typing  namespace name user can go straight to it by clicking `enter`.
- Make input field autofocused on namespace select menu open.
- Add filter option based on input field text to listed namespaces.
- Improve overall UI of namespace select menu.
- Allow namespace change to ""non-existing namespace"". This has to work in case user does not have permission to list namespaces but can list resources in given namespace.

## TODO
- [x] Add tests

The version **14.5.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of browserify.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **2.6.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of async.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

- `--auto-generate-certificates`
- `--enable-insecure-login`

### Auto-generate certificates
It allows us to get rid of init container. Passing `--auto-generate-certificates` option will make Dashboard generate self-signed certs and store them in directory specified by `--default-cert-dir` flag.

### Insecure login
As per request from some of our users I have also added option to enable login view when Dashboard is not served directly over HTTPS. It allows users to benefit from login functionality at their own risk.

### Build
Build pipeline has been adjusted and 2 new arguments can be passed when serving Dashboard in dev mode.
Use `gulp serve <arguments>`

New arguments:
- `--autoGenerateCerts`
- `--defaultCertDir=<path>`

dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/dashboard/pulls/2598,https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/2598,floreks,Improve workloads statuses graphs on overview page,"Fixes #2593 

### Changes
- Reorganized resources on overview page (sorted alphabetically per group)
- Added resource status ratio charts for all resource on overview page.
- Show information about status and number of related resources on chart hover, i.e. hovering over green color on pods chart can show `Running: 4`.
- Removed unnecessary `IsTypeFilled` calls on backend.
- Added `Status` struct to all resource list objects that contain basic info about the state of resources on the list.
- Made resource charts easier to customize.

There is an issue (visible on below ss) with graph not being fully filled. It's related to how nvd3 handles showing charts. There is not much we can do right now.

## Changes
- Add `CanI` method to client manager so we can check if current user has access to given endpoint.
- Add `/cani` subresource url to `global/settings` endpoint. This way `cani` logic for every endpoint can be kept in backend instead of frontend.
- Refactor `client` package to follow other packages and extract types to `api/types.go` file.
- Add `AuthorizerService` in frontend with appropriate proxy method to get resurces from backend. In case user does not have access to given page `403 Forbidden Access` error will be shown. It can be extended later to support more verbs like PUT and DELETE.
- Fix race condition that caused SIGSEGV error during Dashboard start (related to secret synchronization).

The version **20171203.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of google-closure-library.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **2.14.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of npm-check-updates.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **4.12.1** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of d3.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **5.1.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of gulp-filter.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **5.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of gulp-watch.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Closed the old PR #2544 which I created for the same functionality,
This PR adds only external links for persistentvolume, this does not have any userlinks support for pod and service like PR #2544 does.

The version **15.1.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of browserify.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

At best, those files are auto-removed shortly after being written and the server startup races with the removal.

At worst, the location is mounted readonly and the dashboard fails to start.

There's no reason to write files to a location where they will just be cleaned up later (and doing so is breaking the dashboard when the location is read-only... see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58720/files#diff-7ab88bb7654d97946d6328f11f29d177)

The version **3.10.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of watchify.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **16.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of browserify.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **5.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of gulp-autoprefixer.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **3.2.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of gulp-sass.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **20180319.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of google-closure-compiler.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **1.7.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of angular.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **1.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of gulp-replace.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **1.7.1** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of angular.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

I wanted to start contributing more to this repo but found that spinning up a development environment wasn't that easy (for reference I'm on OSX and had a couple others follow the docs and run into trouble)

What this does is simple: update NPM and install Gulp. This should not affect anything else the container is used for. What this does is allow people to more easily spin up and use the container to run as their dev environment without invoking Gulp (instead Gulp is used within the container)

From there, spinning up a dev environment is as easy as:

```
docker build -t kubernetes-dashboard-build-image build/
docker run --rm -e KUBE_DASHBOARD_APISERVER_HOST=http://192.168.2.1:8080 -p 3001:3001 -p 9090:9090 -p 9091:9091 -ti -v $(pwd):/app kubernetes-dashboard-build-image gulp serve
kubectl proxy --port=8080 --accept-hosts='^.*$'
```

Once this (hopefully) gets merged, I'd like to update the Getting Started documentation to reflect this as a more streamlined way to spin up a development environment. :)

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for dashboard :muscle:

⚠️ Greenkeeper has found a `package-lock.json` file in this repository. Please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure this gets updated as well.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.

**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.





---
<details>
<summary>💥 Tests on this branch are failing. Here’s how to proceed.</summary>

To solve the issue, first find out which of the dependency’s updates is causing the problem. Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Then push your changes to this branch and merge it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

To make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # Change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # Adapt your code until everything works again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push origin greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>

After you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

The above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

However, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.

This way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

This means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.

These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:

To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.

Requirements:

- `ng-migration` branch checked out.
- Deps should be up-to-date. Use `rm -rf node_modules && npm i` after switching branches to ensure that.

After I turned off --aot, I found that the app has some circular dependency issues.

The issue is mainly caused by that the global service module and dialog module has some indirect imports between each other. A safer way is to move the dialog module to the parent of global service module, thus global service module and dialog module would have the same level of import paths.

Also resource service module is not necessarily imported by many features since it is a provider only module.

This directly addresses #3174, #3012, and potentially others. 

I created a list of addresses that may potentially have sensitive information that should not be logged. Instead it will only log `{ contents hidden }`. 

However, in some cases (like debugging and development) you still want to see what's being passed along. So I added a new CLI argument to the dashboard called `--api-log-level` with three options: INFO,DEBUG,NONE

The default setting is INFO, which will log everything but sensitive URLs. 
NONE will turn off all request/response logging.
DEBUG will log everything including the contents of sensitive URLs.

I added tests for all this, and also updated `TestFormatRequestLog` to handle more diverse test cases.

Yet even within a namespace, other than `kube-system`, the dashboard will still try to add secrets to the `kube-system` ns.

This attempts to open the discussion around how to fix it. In this case, I've added a simple flag to the binary (still needs some tests and url validation).

The following flag was added:
`--namespace string   When non-default namespace is used, create encryption key in the specified namespace. Default: 'kube-system'. (default ""kube-system"")`

Another idea is for the dashboard to lookup what namespace it's running in, and simply use that. :fire: and :speaking_head:  are welcome :)

- [X] Get the latest Angular test framework and see the examples
- [X] Fork from the ng-migration branch https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/tree/ng-migration

- How granular you want to do the test, in here I split the test into 4 tests, should I combine all into one test?
- Is it ok to use automatic detection (ComponentFixtureAutoDetect)?
- Do you have the webstorm code style setttings, I like to do the code format but it looks not align perfectly with the tslint.
- I commented out run-go-vet in https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3212/commits/28aba3efd4a29eba8d0e423f21d48e2bad49cf68, could you please help me on why I always get error with message ""warning: ""github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/src/app/backend/..."" matched no packages no packages to vet husky > pre-commit hook failed (add --no-verify to bypass)""

This happens if the configMap exists but does not have any data in it, and in this case it was not possible to update the dashboard settings.

For example, the configMap provided here causes the bug: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/0928bb4c01f6e7ed7c8b990693dd9ea27873def7/cluster/addons/dashboard/dashboard-configmap.yaml

When trying to save, this is the stacktrace that was returned. It does not show up in the UI though, had to find it by using the chrome developer tools.

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for dashboard :muscle:

🔒 Greenkeeper has found a `package-lock.json` file in this repository. Greenkeeper supports lockfile updates for public packages. If you use private packages in your repository, please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure these can get updated as well.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.

**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.





---
<details>
<summary>💥 Tests on this branch are failing. Here’s how to proceed.</summary>

To solve the issue, first find out which of the dependency’s updates is causing the problem. Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Then push your changes to this branch and merge it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>🏗 How to configure Travis CI</summary>

Greenkeeper has added a rule to your `.travis.yml` that whitelists Greenkeeper branches, which are created when your dependencies are updated. Travis CI will run your tests on these branches automatically to see if they still pass.

No additional setup is required 😊

</details>
<details>
<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

To make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # Change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch --all
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # Adapt your code until everything works again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard.git greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>

After you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

The above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

However, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.

This way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

This means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.

These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:

To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.

Locally I keep having to change `package.json` or `.npmrc` to use it. We can do better.

This wraps `gulp serve` in a script that checks to see if `$KUBECONFIG` is set. If it is, it uses it. Otherwise, it defaults to the `kubernetes-dashboard:kubeconfig` values in `.npmrc`

I would have avoided _yet another wrapper script_ but I can't put the necessary logic in `.npmrc`, and it'd be super ugly in `package.json`

Current changes:
- Refactor error handling on the backend to a single package. All errors should be created using our internal package.

What's missing:
- [x] Proper query params handling. By default, it should at least have `namespace` query set to `default` namespace.
- [x] Proper path params handling for detail views. Only `Cluster Role` details view is working right now.
- [ ] Remove usage of old `ui-router` classes i.e. `StateService`, `Transition`, etc. in all places and replace them with angular router equivalents.

The SettingsManager took in a clientManager, which was only used by the SettingsHandler. This PR moves the clientManager to the SettingsHandler.",['maciaszczykm'],1,2019-04-05 09:14:33,2019-04-05 09:23:19,2019-04-05 09:23:30,True,2019-04-05 09:23:19,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed
