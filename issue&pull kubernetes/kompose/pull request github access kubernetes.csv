kompose,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kompose/pulls/5,https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose/pull/5,janetkuo,Support printing to stdout,"Fixes #2

Add a `-out` / `-stdout` flag for printing to stdout. Doesn't support printing helm chart since it doesn't make sense (or does it?). I think the naming of the flag could be better but I couldn't think of a better one for now. 

Some unsolved issues found while developing:
1. Services should be created first if possible
2. It seems output to helm chart is only supported when there's `xxx-rc.json` (not yaml, not other controllers)
3. Right now we don't stop users from creating more than one type of controllers (rc, rs, deployment, ...), but this won't work while printing to stdout and pipe to kubectl, so I changed the logic to just use the first flag specified. Does that sound good? We'll need some verification for incorrect flag usage also.

- Tested with all test cases we have `make test-cmd`.
- Need to enable CGO as required by vendor/github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer/system/sysconfig.go
- Scanned vendor/ and removed all unused packages.
- Many packages also being upgraded accordingly as they harmonize with libcompose, but do not conflict with kompose. Such as:
  - github.com/docker/docker
  - github.com/docker/distribution
  - github.com/opencontainers/runc

This has similar behavior as `kompose up` for k8s. It assumes that you already have `.kube/config` setup (you are logged using `oc login`). 
It converts docker-compose.yaml to DeploymentConfigs, Services and ImageStreams, those objects are then deployed to OpenShift cluster.

This PR also updates bunch of vendored libs.
Mainly  OpenShift 1.4.0-alpha.0 this is required to avoid collisions between Docker version that is required by OpenShift and version that Kompose requires for bundle support.
Upgrading OpenShift forced updates for a lots of other libs. Kubernetes is now in version v1.4.0-beta.3

Issue is that in docker-compose you can set `user` by user name or uid. But K8S allows you to set user only by its uid (has to be int).

This is why I added warning that tells user that `user` directive will be ignored if its not a number.
Here is user unfriendly part, in docker-compose even if you set user by it uid, it has to be string. (user: ""2324"") If you set it as int (user: 2324) libcompose parser will complain about this not being string.

So now Kompose requires `user` to be number but written as string :-(

How can we convert `cpu_share` defined in [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) to `cpu` defined in [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/) as there is no one to one mapping for it. 

**Docker** by default gives all containers get the same proportion of CPU cycles and by using `cpu_share` we can give a percentage of CPU to each container.
 
In **Kubernetes** world, cpu are measured in unit. The expression `0.1` is equivalent to the expression `100m`, which can be read as “one hundred millicpu”. CPU is always requested as an absolute quantity, never as a relative quantity; `0.1` is the same amount of `cpu` on a single core, dual core, or 48 core machine.

- First off, urfave/cli has been removed in favour of spf13/cobra. With
  this, comes changes to the formatting as well as the help page for
  Kompose.

- Upon converting, I noticed a CLI flag was NOT appearing for OpenShift.
  Specifically, `--deploymentconfig`. This has been added with a note
  that says it is OpenShift only.

- Exit codes have been fixed. If the conversion / down / up fails for
  any reason, Kompose will exit with Code 1.

- `--verbose` as well as `--suppress-warnings` can now be set at the
  same time.

- `app_test.go` in the cli directory has been moved to `pkg/transformer`
  to better reflect the testing coverage.

- `version.go` has been removed and converted to it's own CLI command in
  conjuction with (most) Go software. A new CLI command has been
  created. `kompose version`

- `--dab` isn't a conventional way for short-form CLI paramters. This
  has been shortened to `-b` for bundle.

- CLI flags consisting of only two/three letters have been removed due to
  it being unconventional for CLI. For example, `--dc` was removed in preference
  for `--deploymentconfig`

- `--replicas` has been added as an option when using `kompose down` or
  `kompose up`. This has been added as previously in `app.go` the
  replica amount was hard-coded as `1`.

- Differentiating names have been used for flags. For example,
  persistent flags use the name Global (ex. GlobalOut). Command-specific
  flags have their own names (ex. UpOpt).

I tried to use Glide instead of Godep, setting up was surprisingly easy.
With only one catch: You need to run `glide update` with `--strip-vendor` otherwise glide keeps vendor directories inside kompose vendor dir (`/vendor/.../vendor/...`) In some project this can be useful, but kompose can't be build whit this.
Overall I really like glide.

**But** (there is always but :sunglasses: )
It looks like glide is not striping unused code from vendored dependencies , like godep does.
with glide vendor is **277M** :-(
with godep it was **52M**

https://github.com/sgotti/glide-vc might help with that. (haven't tried yet)
Or we can remove vendor from git as @ngtuna suggested [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kompose/pull/297#issuecomment-263586556). But I expressed my view there.

A brief introdction:
- When multiple docker compose files are passed, we should parse every compose file and override previous object if next compose file has this field
- Docker compose merge multiple file, so we should do so
- This function is very useful
- First, I implemented the v3 compose version. Please @cdrage @hangyan help me review. If you guys accept this method, I will do the same thing to v2 compose version.

For service `db`, we'd better convert it to `StatefulSet`. But if we run command `kompose convert -f `, all of them are converted to `Deployment`. We have to split them into two compose file.So we'd better support a label which can control what type you want to convert.

After that, a compose like this
```
web:
  image: wordpress:4.5
  ports:
    - '80'
  environment:
    WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY: changeme
    WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY: changeme
    WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY: changeme
    WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY: changeme
    WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT: changeme
    WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT: changeme
    WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT: changeme
    WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT: changeme
    WORDPRESS_NONCE_AA: changeme
  restart: always
  links:
    - 'db:mysql'
db:
  image: mysql:5.7
  environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
  restart: always
  labels:
    project.logs: /var/log/mysql
    kompose.controller.type: daemonset
```
So service web convert to `Deployment`, service db convert to `StatefulSet`, it's very useful.

E.g. 

```
version: '2'

    image: test
    ports:
      - ""1234:1234""
      - ""1234:1234/udp""
```

The generated service config is as following

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    kompose.version: 1.13.0 (84fa826)
  creationTimestamp: null

    port: 1234
    protocol: UDP
    targetPort: 1234
  selector:
    io.kompose.service: bootstrap
```

The following exception will be return when creating service

The Service ""bootstrap"" is invalid: spec.ports[1].name: Invalid value: ""1234-UDP"": a DNS-1123 label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'my-name',  or '123-abc', regex used for validation is '[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?')

We should append the lower case of protocol as part of the port name.

volumes:

      kompose.volume.size: 500Mi
