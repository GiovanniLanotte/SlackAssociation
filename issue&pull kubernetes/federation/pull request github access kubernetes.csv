Adds Azure DNS support to federation

Fixes Issue #44874 

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

**Release note**:
```release-note

The federation provider for AzureDNS allows for using AzureDNS to manage DNS records for federated kubernetes clusters. The clusters do not have to run in Azure.

Running the provider requires

	• an active Azure subscription with a DNS zone configured. See Azure Docs on how to [configure a DNS Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records).
	• Service Principal credentials with permissions to manage the DNS Zone

To configure federation, you follow the steps at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/federation/set-up-cluster-federation-kubefed/

Note, that at this time, a cluster created with acs-engine may need kubernetes RBAC (not Azure RBAC) configured first. See detailed instructions link below.

The DNS provider needs a configuration file with the information to access the Azure Subscription. The format of the config file is:

[Global]
subscription-id = [Azure Subscription ID]
tenant-id = [Azure Tenant ID where the Service Principal is created]
client-id = [Service Principal Client ID]
secret = [Service Principal Secret]
resourceGroup = [Azure Resource Group where the DNS Zone is provisioned]

You can get Subscription ID and Tenant ID by running the following Azure CLI 2.0 command:

`az account show`


You can create a Service Principal with write access to the resource group:

`az ad sp create-for-rbac -n ""http://MyApp"" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]`

With the provider config file, you can initialize a federation:

`kubefed init myfederation --host-cluster-context=[cluster name] --dns-provider=""azure-azuredns"" --dns-zone-name=""[dns Zone]"" --dns-provider-config=[path to provider config file]`

Join a federation:

`kubefed join [your cluster name] --host-cluster-context=[your cluster name] --cluster-context=[your cluster name]`

And verify that the cluster was joined:

kubectl get clusters
NAME STATUS AGE
fed-west Ready 13s

For complete instructions setting up federated clusters in Azure see: https://github.com/xtophs/k8s-setup-federation-cluster

A better mechanism to avoid running into this problem is that federation also updates all the apis that it uses to talk to k8s and to store in its registry.
