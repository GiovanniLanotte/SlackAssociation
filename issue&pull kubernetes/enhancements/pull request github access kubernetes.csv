I have dropped TODO's on places that need filling in.  I will send followon PR's as I am able to help with content and wordsmithing.

I started with the release-1.5/release-notes-draft.md file, and removed all content under the existing headings.

I used the following script to start populating the features section
```sh
for sig in $(hub issue -M 6 | sed -e 's|.*sig/\([^ ]*\).*|\1|g' | sort | uniq); do
  echo ""- **$sig**""
  for stage in alpha beta stable; do 
    hub issue -M 6 -l sig/$sig,stage/$stage -f \
      ""  - [$stage] %t ([kubernetes/features%i](%U))%n"";
  done
done
```

I noticed the following sections in the release-1.6/release-notes-draft.md file, but have explicitly left them out here.  Please add back in if you feel they're necessary:
- WARNING: etcd backup strongly recommneded
- Changes to API Resources
- Changes to Major Components
- Changes to Cluster Provisioning Scripts
- Changes to Addons

I manually replaced the feature issue titles with one-line release notes from the [feature tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJSTd3MHorwUt8i492GQaKKuAFsZppauT4v1LJ91WHY/edit#gid=0)

Use cases
A lot of game player will play games from Friday evening to Sunday evening. It will be better to provide a better experience for players if game servers(pods) could be scaled to a lager size at Friday evening and scaled to normal size at Sunday evening. And that's what game server admins do every week.

Some other customers also do similar things because their products' usage also have peaks and valleys periodically. CronHPA is for their requirement.

This proposal is to implement support for the ability to nest CSI volume declarations within pod specs:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: testpod
spec:
  containers:
    ...
  volumes:
      - name: vol
        csi:
          driver: mock.storage.kubernetes.io
          volumeAttributes:
              name: ""Mock Volume 1""
          volumeHandle: ""1""
```

This would put CSI drivers on feature parity with existing in-tree storage plugins which already support this volume deployment mode.

Instead, a new field would need to be added and go through API review.

Because the full context of why this is needed is captured in the Windows KEP, I thought it would make sense to capture the investigation and proposed API change into the existing KEP.

Content aside, my first question for the release team and approvers (@bgrant0607 from SIG-Architecture, @dchen1107 from SIG-Node, @spiffxp from release) is if you think this is the right path forward, or should it be captured in it's own KEP? Should adding a new OS-specific field go through alpha/beta/stable process across 3 releases?

I thought having a draft of what it would look like would make the discussion easier, so now we're at this PR :)

I've refocused the document on the API and kubelet changes, and put changes to kubectl out of scope for this document. I've also updated the API for changes we've made during API review.

This KEP draft is still marked provisional for a quick merge and to get the process started.
