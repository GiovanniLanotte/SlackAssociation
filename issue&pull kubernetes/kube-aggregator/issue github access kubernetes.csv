The template for the file can be found in the kubernetes-template repository[2].
A description for the file is in the steering-committee docs[3], you might need
to search that page for ""Security Contacts"".

Please feel free to ping me on the PR when you make it, otherwise I will see when
you close this issue. :)

Thanks so much, let me know if you have any questions.

kube-aggregator,JulienBalestra,https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-aggregator/issues/13,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kube-aggregator/issues/13,APIservice and CaBundle,"I would like to know if there is an easy way to register Kubernetes APIServices with the certificate authority bundle from the configmap `extension-apiserver-authentication` in the namespace `kube-system`.

As example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: APIService
metadata:
  name: v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io
spec:
  caBundle: ""REQUEST_HEADER_CLIENT_CA""
  service:
    name: metrics-server
    namespace: kube-system
  group: metrics.k8s.io
  version: v1beta1
  groupPriorityMinimum: 100
  versionPriority: 100
```

Today, I need to go through an intermediate template process to populate the `caBundle` field.

Could we think of a default `caBundle` when this field is `nil` ?

An example could be this [one](https://github.com/JulienBalestra/kube-csr/blob/8a0b8049f98b711aa35fcb3e8213238cad71f9f0/examples/metrics-server.yaml#L118-L126).",open,False,2018-07-31 19:00:16,2019-02-04 14:39:25
