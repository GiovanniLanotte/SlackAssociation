---

This is an alternative implementation of https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1982

Notable differences from the original PR are:

* A new flag named `--node-group-auto-discovery` is introduced for opting in to enable the auto-discovery feature.
  * For example, specifying `--cloud-provider aws --node-group-auto-discovery asg:tag=k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled` instructs CA to auto-discover ASGs tagged with `k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled` to be used as target node groups
* The new code path introduced by this PR is executed only when `node-group-auto-discovery` is specified. There is relatively less chance to break existing features by introducing this change

Resolves https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/1956

---

Other notes:

* ~~I thought it might be a good idea to implement this feature on top of the dynamic reconfiguration #2181 initially~~
  * ~~However it turned out it is easier and less verbose to just implement an alternative aws cloud provider like what I've done for this PR~~
* We rely mainly on the `DescribeTags` API rather than `DescribeAutoScalingGroups` so that AWS can filter out unnecessary ASGs which doesn't belong to the k8s cluster, for us.
  * If we relied on `DescribeAutoScalingGroups` here, as it doesn't support `Filter`ing, we'd need to iterate over ALL the ASGs available in an AWS account, which isn't desirable due to unnecessary excessive API calls and network usages

TODO/Possible future improvements before recommending this to everyone:

* Cache the result of an auto-discovery for a configurable period, so that we won't invoke DescribeTags and DescribeAutoScalingGroup APIs too many times

Please beware of the edge case - this method is safe as long as users don't attach nodes by calling AttachInstances API after CA cached them. I believe, even if it was necessary, a warning in the documentation about the edge case is enough for now. If we really need to support the case, I will submit an another PR to invalidate the cache periodically so that CA can detect the formerly cached nodes are attached to ASG(s).

The docker image built from this branch is available for testing at `mumoshu/fix-excessive-describe-asg-calls`.

You can see that CA detects and remembers nodes in unmanaged ASGs so that it can prevent the nodes from triggering unnecessary `regenerateCache` invocations afterwards:

Resolves #85 

This is how I'm going to test it:

- [x] Build and release a CA docker image `quay.io/kube-aws/cluster-autoscaler:8b7d410fc5b9dbc9b7c707994259770f15613676`
- [x] Deploy CA with [the example yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/11#issuecomment-297737376)
- [x] Create a k8s deployment as a scaling target: `kubectl run php-apache --image=gcr.io/google_containers/hpa-example --requests=cpu=1000m,memory=1000M --expose --port=8`
- [x] Do a few manual tests with scaling a deployment up and down (Accordingly to [FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-should-i-test-my-code-before-submitting-pr))
  - [x] Confirm that scale-up occurs
  - [x] Confirm that scale-down occurs (Added 8b7d410 in order to fix the issue found here)
    - `kubectl scale deployment php-apache --replicas 1` and wait for the default scale-down-delay - 10 minutes
- [x] ~~Run e2e test suite on AWS, confirm it passes and all metrics have reasonable values after it's done~~
  * It turned out that e2e for CA doesn't work on AWS, probably due to e2e's inability to determine original cluster size which is required in order to reset the cluster size after each test. [Revelant log can be seen in my gist](https://gist.github.com/mumoshu/f73d2bbf45f82d732cc577524e7ca2f7)

We should use [the kubernetes cluster tag `kubernetes.io/cluster/<YOUR CLUSTER NAME>`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/9ef85a7/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/aws/tags.go#L30-L34) to differentiate ASGs from different k8s clusters.

I have built and tested this on one of our clusters. 

If no autoscaling group matches both tags, the autoscaler exits and is restarted by kubernetes.

As soon as one ASG matches both tags, CA will stay up and run as designed. If this group is then removed (by changing the tags as described in the issue), then CA will also exit and get into a restart loop as above.

I considered returning an empty list of ASGs, but I believe this isn't the correct approach. If you return an empty list of ASGs then CA will continue through it's working process and only when it gets to the point where it wants to scale up or scale down will it fail. I feel users would prefer to know CA can't do anything earlier than this.

I also considered the fact that maybe CA should just emit a message and keep running and keep trying to build the cloudprovider on an interval so that it doesn't constantly restart the container (given it's run as a deployment, it will be in constant crash loops), but this requires discussion and is beyond the scope of this PR.",['mwielgus'],1,2017-08-30 13:11:55,2017-08-30 17:26:02,2017-10-19 09:09:01,True,2017-08-30 17:26:02,mwielgus,unknown,,closed

The idea is to internally override status of nodes which should have GPUs to unready until they actually have allocatable GPU. That way our normal logic for handling long starting up nodes kicks in and counts those nodes in simulations.

The downside is we have to use the same timeout for GPU node start-up + driver installation as for normal nodes (defaults to 15 minutes, which may not be enough - we may need to temporarily increase this for 1.8).

Also fixes the issue where GCP pricing model was using old GPU resource name and not taking GPU into account when calculating node cost (leading to very sad scale-up decisions in my test...).",['mwielgus'],4,2017-11-10 16:57:00,2017-11-13 14:29:28,2017-11-13 14:29:28,True,2017-11-13 14:29:28,mwielgus,unknown,,closed

GCE instance groups can be automatically discovered based on a prefix of their group name. Example usage:
```
--node-group-auto-discovery=mig:prefix=k8s-mig,minNodes=0,maxNodes=10
```
Note that unlike the existing AWS ASG autodetection functionality we must specify the min and max nodes in the flag. This is because MIGs store only a target size in the GCE API - they do not have a min and max size we can infer via the API.

In order to alleviate this limitation a little we allow multiple uses of the autodiscovery flag. For example to discover two classes (big and small) of instance groups with different size limits:
```
./cluster-autoscaler \
  --node-group-auto-discovery=mig:prefix=k8s-a-small,minNodes=1,maxNodes=10 \
  --node-group-auto-discovery=mig:prefix=k8s-a-big,minNodes=1,maxNodes=100
```
Zonal clusters (i.e. `multizone = false` in the cloud config) will detect all managed instance groups within the cluster's zone. Regional clusters will detect all matching (zonal) managed instance groups within any of the cluster's region's zones.","['bskiba', 'MaciekPytel', 'mwielgus']",4,2017-11-11 04:56:23,2017-12-18 20:08:23,2018-02-27 22:42:38,True,2017-12-18 20:08:23,mwielgus,unknown,,closed

Typically my clusters are setup to scale a homogenous set of node groups. I need only one flavour of node, but I want my nodes to be spread across all zones in an AWS or GCE region. I create one node group per zone so the CA can make intelligent scaling decisions for pods that must be created in a particular zone (i.e. to access cloud provider backed physical volumes).

When using the random expander with 3-4 node groups I notice it often picks an already quite large node group to expand. I end up with some node groups that have orders of magnitude more nodes than others for no real reason.

 - If there is a pending pod with GPU request NAP will create a node pool with nvidia P80 for it
 - If the pod uses nodeSelector on `cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator` label NAP will use the value of node selector to determine GPU type (you can get nvidia P100 by setting nodeSelector `cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator: nvidia-tesla-p100`).
 - New node pools with gpu will come with taint `gke-accelerator: <gpu_type>` with no schedule effect (to mitigate the risk of pods not requiring GPU landing on expensive node with GPU, there is no way user can do it themselves in NAP)
 - We validate if a node pool with GPU can be created against criteria specified in https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/ (zone with GPU enabled, maximum CPU/GPU ratio, number of GPUs on node)

This PR adds initial support for Azure virtual machine availability sets (VMAS). Significant changes include

- Add `vmType` parameters to indicate different virtual machine types. Candidate values are 'vmss' and 'standard'
- Add agent pools implementation (standard vmType) of NodeGroup
- Add more options for scaling agent pools
- Add more fake clients and unit tests

Special notes for reviewers:

- Only one node group supported yet
- Some functions (in azure_util.go) are copied from acs-engine. They are not ventured because of various vendor problems, e.g. i18n and go template. acs-engine should be adjusted before vendoring those functions
- Azure API calls may hit requests count limits which need to be addressed in further PRs

VPA recommender requires the latest version of metrics API to work.
The latest version of metrics API required other dependencies to be updated as well.
This, in turn, required some modifications in code. The most serious one is switching from `CreatedByAnnotation` to `OwnerReferences` in updater eviction algorithm.

Since this is empty calling ```nannyconfigalpha.FillInDefaults_NannyConfiguration``` doesn't actually do anything as it compares the values against default values, so when all values are empty this does nothing. In the end function just returns empty values for everything and never uses command line arguments.

of those ASG details in a single request on each `Refresh()` with maximum 10 seconds granularity.

This reduced the amount of DescribeAutoScalingGroups API calls for our setup (3 ASGs / one per AZ) from ~55 calls / min to ~5 calls / min.

As the DescribeAutoScalingGroups supports up to 1600 members per call, this approach should be fairly scalable https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoScalingGroups.html and work for more complicated setups.

I'm still testing this PR with our clusters, but I can't see any major downsides in requesting an up-to-date status only every 10s vs. on-demand as the main loop isn't executed more frequently and its unlikely that ASG API is changing responses frequently, but I'm not sure that I understand all nuances of the code yet.

Technically I would be possible to keep the auto-discovery tag to ASG names matching at a 1 minute cadence, but I didn't though the added complexity is worth saving those 5 calls / min.

This fixes both the trivial issues where instance type change is not taken into account until the user gets lucky with node ordering and more complicated ones where pods using node affinities sometimes don't trigger scale up (see comments in #789).

I think that this should be the default behaviour, because the current one is non-intuitive and hard to debug. However, since the users might rely on existing logic and use node selectors without the corresponding tags on the ASGs, the flag defaults to `false`.

One more change I've made selects a random AZ when constructing a template node for a multi-AZ ASG in the AWS cloud provider. Previously, the autoscaler always used the first AZ, but since this was masked by the default logic of using a random existing node it *sort of* worked when existing nodes got added or removed.

I might be wrong, but it is my understanding that pod Update review has no impact through VPA admission controller.   It would be doing work that will have no effect at the end.

For a cluster with a large number of vpa objects, the default qps is too low (5 I believe) for it to finish processing quickly and you end up getting a lot of noise related to throttling.

This PR adds basic support for specifying and customizing qps and burst, and will be applied the setting to both checkpoint writer and vpcClient.

As the current AWS implementation only updates `TargetSize` when refreshing the ASG list every minutes (less when being rate-limited), the cached `TargetSize` might quickly mismatch the actual value.

While each ASG change could trigger a cache refresh, I don't think this is optimal as it introduces again further requests.

Instead I decided to pre-calculate the `TargetSize` change for AWS on AutoScalingGroup changes and Node deletion to make better balancing decisions.

Any wrongly pre-calculated `TargetSize` will be auto-corrected on the next successful ASG list refresh.","['losipiuk', 'aleksandra-malinowska']",1,2018-11-05 23:08:12,2018-11-19 11:01:51,2018-11-19 11:01:51,True,2018-11-19 11:01:51,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

The  `(*cloudprovider/aws/AwsManager).getAsgTemplatelookup` method does not anticipate such a lookup failure, and panics shortly afterward by attempting to dereference the resulting null pointer as a would-be instance type descriptor.

Instead, trap such lookup failures and return an indicative failure, noting which ASG is trying to use which instance type that the autoscaler has never heard of.

Note that the recent #1422 freshens the autoscaler's instance type catalog, making such lookup failures less likely for the next EC2 product cycle or two, but this patch makes it easier for operators to diagnose such a problem without losing the autoscaler entirely.

or LaunchConfigruration when specifying the config for the instances in an autoscaling group.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-auto-scaling-groups-with-multiple-instance-types-purchase-options/

The MixedInstancesPolicy holds a reference to a LaunchTemplate... plus an number of overides
that can overide the instance type specified in the LaunchTemplate.  Thus when using this
type an autoscaling group can schedule multiple instance types.

The MixedInstancesPolicy also allows some percentage of instances in the autoscaling group to be
launched as spot instances, this is kindof othoganal to this PR, but the main reason I wan't to be
able to configure ASGs in this way + use cluster autoscaler.

MixedInstancesPolicy breaks Cluster Autoscaler a bit since there is no longer an LaunchTemplate / Configuration
to discover the instance type from, when the ASG was scaled to 0.

This change makes it so that the cluster autoscaler will work again ...

I have made a few (hopefully reasonable) assumptions:

Firstly where there are instance types specified in multiple overidees, I presume that they will all
have an equivelent amount of resources.

e.g.If I creating an ASGs that has m5.large, m4.large and m3.large overides .... and AWS is choosing
the instance type with the best spot price ... but these three instance types have (roughly) the same
level of resources... so the autoscaler can still work properly... even though we don't know exactly
which instance type will be chosen. The code change just take the instance type from the first override.",[],2,2018-12-03 17:19:07,2019-02-07 12:17:28,2019-02-07 12:43:08,False,,,unknown,,closed

autoscaler,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/autoscaler/pulls/1481,https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/1481,multi-io,cloud provider for cluster-api,"This is an initial implementation of a new cloud provider (named ""clusterapi"") that uses cluster-api (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/) for creating and managing nodes via the K8s API itself rather than any particular cloud API. We've tested this in clusters with the Kubermatic machine-controller (https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller). The way it works it that cluster-api defines CRDs for ""Machines"" -- which represent machines in the backing cloud (which become nodes after successful initialization; see below), and MachineSets and MachineDeployments, which are to machines what ReplicaSets and Deployments are to pods: A MachineSet or MachineDeployment declares a replica count, and a corresponding controller (part of cluster-api) will create and (in the case of MachineDeployments) rolling-upgrade (if needed) a corresponding set of machine objects. Machine-controller, which has its own cloud provider layer, will then create and provision Kubernetes machines in a cloud environment, which will boot up, register with the API server and eventually show up as nodes.

What this autoscaler cloud provider does is expose all the MachineDeployments as node groups, and simply manipulate the replica count when asked to scale a node group.

The cloud provider works nicely in our setup (we're running on an OpenStack cloud). It's not feature-complete yet though; there are a couple of caveats:

- we've vendored a slightly older version of cluster-api because the current master contains a breaking change (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/548) that machine-controller's version of cluster-api doesn't yet have

- downscaling doesn't work currently -- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/558 is needed for this and wasn't merged until very recently -- we'd implement this next, wanted to get some feedback on the PR first

- ClusterapiNodeGroup.TemplateNodeInfo(), which is used to estimate new nodes' resources when scaling up empty MachineDeployments, is entirely Openstack-specific right now (because that's what we use) and won't work anywhere else. It extracts the information from the MachineDeployment's providerConfig, which contains the cloud-specific configuration to use for new machines in the deployment. We're not sure how to implement this for other clouds except manually.

- we might want to support scaling of MachineSets, not just MachineDeployments

The PR contains two required changes outside the new cloud provider itself, currently provided as separate commits in the PR to make  the review easier:

- since this cloud provider's cloud-config is just the cluster's kubeconfig, we had to change `AutoscalerOptions` and the cloud provider builder so we pass the kubeconfig down to `buildCloudProvider` (https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/commit/fdb83cde659f011c1d6f1dd84ef6e3050899a402). This change was previously provided as a separate PR (https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/1413).

- cluster-api currently still uses glog, while autoscaler uses klog. In the current upstream, this causes a runtime panic (""redefined: log_dir"") at https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/d53928a11d422256ee452a8aa5e397b9e4823216/cluster-autoscaler/main.go#L324 because `glog.init()` adds a log_dir flag to the global `flag.CommandLine`, and then `klog.InitFlags(nil)` does the same, hence the error. https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/commit/f4f7986862f953e9aa0d4497189dc5175186fec6 fixes this by registering klog's flags into a local flagset, then merging that and `flag.CommandLine` into `pflag.CommandLine`, which is then parsed. The fix will be needed not just for cluster-api but also with any other dependency that uses glog, so this should be of general interest.

`calculateScaleDownGpusTotal()` when `NodeGroupForNode()` is called
for GPU nodes that don't exist. The current logic generates a runtime

Looking through the rest of the tree all the other places that use
this pattern additionally and explicitly check whether `nodeGroup ==
nil` first.

This change now completes the pattern in
`calculateScaleDownGpusTotal()`.

Looking at the other occurrences of this pattern we see:

```

with the notable exception at core/scale_down.go:185 which is
`calculateScaleDownGpusTotal()`.

Thanks for this awesome work!
I noticed in the documentation the use of the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotation that has been deprecated as of version 1.13 and will be removed in 1.14.

So this PR changes the doc to use `priorityClassName: system-cluster-critical`.

Let me know  if I need to change some wording.

Thanks for your help,

Turns out it impacts CA performance quite a bit in large clusters (and it puts an extra load on API server). 

This is preparatory work for migrating those API calls to use watch cache instead.

I decided to use upstream listers directly, rather than wrap them in our own interface. Partly because we will actually need to replace Get() calls which the upstream lister already provides (and our interfaces don't), partly because all we did in our interface was forward the call to upstream interface anyway and using upstream interface feels more consistent with k8s ecosystem.
I've migrated existing daemonSetLister to use upstream interface as well to be consistent with other controllers (and migrated it to use apps/v1.DaemonSet instead of old extensions/v1beta1). I've left other listers as they were, because they actually have custom logic and we won't need Get calls for those.

This requires a more up to date version of gophercloud. The specific newer commit of gophercloud is chosen because the commit following it [changes a function signature](https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/commit/7bd760e8eb1d7c94108db464cc992df1620278d1#diff-18ac4c04e89cf251c4c250ccfa91b7f8R84), and this leads to [problems with k8s.io/kubernetes itself](https://gist.github.com/tghartland/e564a2e57b09e7008a82b4ad18b5c4da).

As of right now this autoscaler only supports OpenStack clusters using Magnum and Heat, but this is done through an interface OpenstackManager. I will be adding another implementation of this interface to support Magnum clusters with proper nodegroups when that is available, but this could also be extended to support any other kind of OpenStack cluster. There is only the Magnum/Heat manager now but it is already set up to support more via changing an environment variable.

All nodegroups managed by the OpenstackCloudProvider interact with openstack through a single instance of the manager.

Since Magnum does not yet have nodegroups, only a single nodegroup is currently allowed and this represents the entire cluster.","['losipiuk', 'mwielgus']",7,2019-02-14 13:55:28,2019-03-15 12:52:57,2019-03-15 13:06:01,True,2019-03-15 12:52:57,k8s-ci-robot,unknown,,closed

For VMSS node's providerIDs, they may be in different cases depending user's PUT requests to the resources. This would cause autoscaler to delete all newly provisioned nodes. And more seriously, CA would scale up/down again and again.

This PR adds a workaround for this issue, so that different cased providerIDs are processed as same node.

As we agreed, #1738 is a temporary workaround for fixing the isues in stable releases. For the following v1.14, https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74882 has made a change in kubernetes repo, so that resourceGroupName in providerID would be always in lower cases.

This PR reverts the changes in #1738 and also aligned the providerID in same format from #74882.

Note that with this change, because the providerID is in different format, master branch (or following v1.14 release) of CA won't work again with kubernetes <=1.14.0-beta.1. This is ok because beta version won't be run in production and CA should always be used with matched version of kubernetes according to the [version matrix ](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler#releases).

> When scaling down we observe unexpected behaviors in the cluster autoscaler, where initially nodes are removed quickly but then mysteriously are added back a few minutes later.

The issue happens because after the virtual machines are removed, CA would also tries to correct the node count by invoking the AKS PUT API. Unfortunately, for bulk removal, multiple virtual machines are deleted in different Go routines, and hence their calculated new counts are wrong.

This PR fixed this issue by adding a lock for ContainerServiceAgentPool. It also adds a cache for getting current node count, so as to reduce the API calls.

this initialization in CA simpler and with less copy-pasting of code

Full autoamted kubernetes e2e tests were not done. The testing procedure was as follows:
1. Unit tests
  `go test ./expander/priority/...`

1. Manual e2e tests
    - I started a test cluster and connected the new cluster-autoscaler binary to it

* code is reworked to use `client-go` (version v8.0.0) and api libs (from 1.11 k8s release)
* go version is updated to 1.12.1

autoscaler,https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/autoscaler/pulls/1866,https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/1866,frobware,Add cluster-api based cloudprovider,"This is a new cloudprovider implementation based on the [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) project.

This PR has been cut from https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes-autoscaler/commit/b38dd11ffab3a1e8641420448ff7c5547072c836 and updated to reflect changes in autoscaler master (1.15); the openshift version is using 1.13. This implementation has been working well for many months and will scale up/down via a MachineSet or a MachineDeployment.

Known limitations:
- does not support scale from 0
- scale down is not currently atomic

Node groups are represented when a MachineSet or MachineDeployment has positive scaling values. The min/max values are encoded as annotations on the respective objects, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  annotations:
    sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-min-size: ""1""
    sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size: ""10""
```

To map between nodes and machines we currently depend on the following annotation getting added to the node object, for example:

```yaml
annotations:
    cluster.k8s.io/machine: ""machine-name""
```

We currently do this using a [nodelink-controller](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator/blob/master/cmd/nodelink-controller/main.go#L63) but we have future plans to remove this and rely on the `node.Spec.ProviderID` value.

For scale down the cloudprovider implementation annotates the machine object with:

```yaml
annotations:
    cluster.k8s.io/cluster-api-delete-machine: <date>
```

and the machine controller will drain the node, delete the machine, then finally delete the node.

- We have future plans to address the scale from 0 limitation using MachineClasses
- We have future plans to address scale down using strategies in the machine controller ",[],4,2019-04-05 14:52:50,,2019-04-05 14:53:54,False,,,unstable,True,open
