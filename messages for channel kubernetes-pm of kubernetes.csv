I am wondering about how the communication design between an operator and its resources should look like. So far we are used to do communication in one direction, which is from the operator to the managed resource. How should it look like in case the managed resource wants to talk back to the operator? E.g. I am thinking about an operator that manages pods in a specific way. In case the pods are restarted or rescheduled I want the operator to know about it. There is now some lifecycle hook support for pods which would be a native entrypoint in this case. I am just wondering what the hook should do. Should it talk to an HTTP API the operator provides or should it update some annotation of the pod itself and the operator has to watch this? I am a bit puzzled on that. WDYT?

So we have a container requesting 400m CPU and according to our cAdvisor-based metric ( `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` ) the usage rate over 2m is around 0.1seconds/second (summed across all CPUs) . We also have a metric tracking the throttled_time (`container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total)`) which shows the rate of throttled time to be 0.5-0.6 seconds/second for that container.

We were wondering whether these are contradictory metrics (the latter metric seems to suggest the container is getting throttled more than half the time) or whether we are misinterpreting one of the two. Thanks","2017-07-31 15:28:33",""

As far as I can see k8s was behaving correctly. We probably want to tune the grace period but we’re obviously trading off “reaction time” for a genuine node failure.

Zum einen kannst du eine Statusseite aktivieren, in der configmap `enable-vts-status: 'true'` hinzufügen, dann ist die Statuseite unter `&lt;nginx-ip&gt;:18080/nginx_status` erreichbar. Das ganze als JSOn unter `/nginx_status/format/json`.
Und um den in Prometheus hinzuzufügen, kannst exemplarisch sowas verwenden (in dem Beispiel ist der K8s Api Server noch unter einem insecuren port erreichbar):
```  - job_name: 'nginx-ingress-controller'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
    - role: pod

Ideally people with solid experience of DevOps environments and good understanding of tool-kits. Either Infra or Dev pedigree is fine, but must have demonstrable AWS (across services) experience and good experience of using Kubernetes (either at enterprise or just a fair bit) 

Plenty of opportunity for professional development here (certifications, training etc.), varied projects, opportunities to work around the world and we're generally a really great bunch of engineers with a brilliant culture. 

If anyone is interested in learning more, feel free to let me know - more than happy to talk about it in some more detail :slightly_smiling_face: 

Thanks so much - Alex!","2017-06-05 14:16:23",""

"kubernetes","kubernetes-pm","U5NMSEY1Y","alexjones","Hi everyone,

We have an opening for a Kubernetes SME to work with us here at Contino (<http://www.contino.io|www.contino.io>).

12 week initial engagement in Germany. 

In short; his project is about enabling AWS consumption using automation and also helping with Kubernetes PaaS using giantswarm.

A key initiative in achieving efficiency and speed in the SDLC is our customers platform. This is a cloud based 'Platform As A Service' which makes it simpler and faster to develop digital consumer facing applications.

We are engaged as an advisory and delivery partner to support the build of the platforms initiative. This would involve contributing to the build of the platform best practices for automation and operability, but also support on-boarding onto the platform whilst also up-skilling and training our customers staff in parallel.

We are tasked with developing an internal AWS capability and remove the reliance on a third party vendor. We are also tasked with looking to teach our customer to understand AWS best practices, using automation and federated access to controlled environments.

As well as insourcing a best practice AWS implementation, our team have identified the value of software containerisation based on Docker and Kubernetes. The customer will require training and upskilling in containers and Kubernetes as they begin consuming and moving workloads onto the platform.

Sorry for the long winded explanation - but I wanted to give you all a good idea of the project. 

We require someone to start with us prior to the 5th July 2017 - if possible to be UK based consultant willing to travel to Germany.

Please contact me directly on DM or at <mailto:alex.jones@contino.io|alex.jones@contino.io>

Many thanks!!

We're looking for somebody in EU to help us respond to possible downtimes of our cluster + improve it by adding better monitoring/alerts, autoscaling, etc..

The reason we're looking for a sysadmin in EU is that half of our customers are there and we are located in San Francisco so if our app goes down when we sleep it's pretty bad for them. They also use our product 8-9h a day so downtimes are really not desirable and is a big problem for us. Enough to look for a freelance sysadmin :slightly_smiling_face:

Here's what I'm thinking you could help us in the first period with:

- Migrate us completely to helm (we've already done it with one our sites), but the main product is still using a combination of replication controllers/services. We want to use helm so that we can have an easier deployment of another staging cluster for example or do tenant isolation.
- Setup a monitoring/alerts for our services. Currently our stack is comprised of a uWSGI python server, flask-socketio, celery workers, rabbitmq cluster and 2 prostgres instances. The alerts should be a bit more based on the load of those services rather than simple up/down state.
- Setup autoscaling for our workers (web and celery) so that they scale according to traffic/rabbitmq available messages in certain queues. At first only k8s autoscaling, then we might launch additional nodes on the cluster too, but that's latter on and not a priority for now.

FYI: we're on GCP using their hosted k8s.

Once we've done all that we'd like to have somebody on pager duty during the day (8h). We're essentially looking to cover the european timezone as much as we can just in case there is something bad going on.

When a pod fail it reboots with an different uuid, resulting in several events.

As it's occurs only 1 time it creates one key in etcd and doesn't stack because of the uuid.
As a result if a pod keep failing it creates thousands of new keys in etcd. Ending up in millions keys if several are failing.

- adding a new binary in stage1 which will convert stdout and stderr streams to CRI format - ttyomux creates sockets in `/var/lib/rkt/pods/&lt;pod_id&gt;/stage1/rootds/rkt/iottymux/&lt;app_name&gt;` directory and the filenames are `stdout.sock` and `stderr.sock` - I imagine that the separate binary will read lines from those sockets, convert each of them to CRI format and then save it to the logfile

- writing CRI logs in `ttyomux` (that implementation was already started, but it's not finished yet) to the logfile

Both solutions will require changes in rkt, not rktlet. Also, since kubelet only assumes that the runtime will write logs to the specified file, we are thinking about mounting `/var/log/pods/&lt;podUID&gt;/` directory into the stage1 and then our new binary will write CRI-compatible logs there. That mount can be handled by systemd-nspawn/machinectl arguments which we pass in rkt when creating stage1 - this can be done by a CLI argument or option.","2017-09-15 12:39:31",""

That means that each pod is slower to start that it normally would, which in turn means they do not get ready fast enough for the life probes.  So they get killed and restarted, going into an endless cycle of CPU feast. Of course I could increase the `initialDelay` on the probs, but then it means I have to wait too long for the pod to be healthy when I do a deployment (and the cluster is not so stressed). Has anyone had this problem? are there strategies to mitigate it?

With ECS and EKS you get a managed master, then you set up your own autoscaling groups etc to deploy nodes (which you manage) into the cluster.
With Fargate, you get access to AWS-managed multi-tenant nodes. So, Fargate connects to either your ECS or EKS cluster and avoids the need for you to worry about managing the nodes as well.

Y a-t-il un moyen de versionner l'état global d'un namespace? Je m'explique : si je crée un namespace ""Project-A-Prod"" dans lequel j'ai 3 déploiements ServiceA (v1.0.0), ServiceB(v1.5.6) et ServiceC(v2.0.1). Au fil des mises à jours, chaque service vit sa vie et arrive un moment où j'aurais peut-être besoin de rollback l'ensemble de ces 3 services dans un état précédent. Je pose cette question car dans le monde de docker-compose, on peut archiver le fichier docker-compose qui pointe sur des versions bien spécifiques des services. J'ai une pseudo notion de ""stack"" que je n'ai plus dans kubernetes. Est-ce quelque chose qu'il faut que je maintienne moi même dans une base à part? Où bien K8S gère les choses complètement différemment?
Je ne trouve pas de bonnes pratiques à ce sujet.

"kubernetes","kubernetes-pm","U6LSA1WCU","fmeriot","bonjour, J'ai une question peut-être un peu naïve, mais enfin ... Je suis nouveau sur Kubernetes, mais j'utilise Rancher depuis 2 ans. Pour ceux qui connaissent, Rancher propose la notion de stack dans laquelle on déploie des services. Une stack est en fait un fichier docker-compose. Si j'ai par exemple un fichier docker-compose avec un service Redis, une base mongoDB et un frontal NodeJS, j'aurais une stack Rancher avec 3 services à l'intérieur (Redis, Mongo et nodejs).

Avec K8S je vais avoir un service Mongo, un service Redis et un service Nodejs qui vont cotoyer d'éventuels d'autres services. 
Alors c'est sans doute ""psycho"" mais j'ai l'impression qu'avec K8S tout est en vrac directement à la racine du namespace.

D'après ce que je comprends de K8S, la notion ""englobante"" des pods est le ""service"". Mais il n'y a rien  au dessus.

Du coup, y a t-il des bonne pratique pour la gestion des namespace et du nommage des services?","2017-08-10 12:38:38",""

Je suis en train de monter un cluster kubernetes sur Scaleway, avec des ubuntu 16.04 avec kubeadm + flannel (pas réussi à initialiser weave) ; tout fonctionne bien. Je cherche à déployer Traefik mais je bute un peu sur comment rendre traefik accessible de l'extérieur sur le bons ports.

Avec ce fichier [1], cela marche bien mais je pense que c'est lié au fait d'avoir un `hostNetork` auquel j'ajoute un `kubectl expose deployment traefik-ingress-controller --type=NodePort --name=""traefik-expose"" -n kube-system`. 

Mais à ce stade, traefik est dispo sur un port &gt;30.000 ; comment je le passe en ""frontal"" sur les ports 80/443 ?

J'ai tenté de faire une conf ingress mais cela n'a rien donné :confused:

Je bosse sur un guide technique autour du monitoring de Kubernetes et du reste d’une infrastructure _containerisée_ et orchestrée avec K8s. La série parle de ce que Kubernetes change pour votre monitoring, identifie les differentes metrics à tracker et comment les collecter.

Avant de publier (semaine prochaine), ce serait vraiment cool d’avoir votre feedback, vu que vous avez probablement encore plus d’experience que moi avec K8s. Je peux vous envoyer les liens en message privé.

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y16jKL2hMjQO0trYBJJSczPAWj8vAgNFrdTZeCincmI/edit#heading=h.qzaj1hoslggu>

about Third Party Resources is pretty important to us here at CoreOS and I imagine for anyone else currently building on top of Kubernetes. I am concerned that this issue hasn't bubbled up to the product level yet. There are also possibly problems with migrating between Third Party Resources as they exist today and how they could exist in the future

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gg158jO1cRBq-8RrWRAWA2IRF9avscuRaWFmY2Wb6qw/edit>

at least as I understand things client-go does not support the required migration and doing so would be a blocker for creating breaking changes to TPR that could also be exposed as a product level concern given the interconnected dependencies","2017-02-16 00:13:43",", U15SSQ58T>,, U0CBHE6GM>"
