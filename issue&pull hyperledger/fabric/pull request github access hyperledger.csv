=============================

O Hyperledger Fabric e uma plataforma para soluções de ledger distribuidas,
por uma arquitetura modular que oferece altos níveis de confidencialidade, resiliência,
flexibilidade e escalabilidade. Ele é projetado para suportar implementações conectáveis
de diferentes componentes e acomodar a complexidade e os meandros que existem
através do ecossistema enxuto.

O Hyperledger Fabric oferece uma arquitetura flexivel e extensível exclusiva
distinguindo de solucoes alternativas de blockchain. Planejamento para o
O futuro do blockchain corporativo requer a construcao de uma 
arquitetura de código aberto. Hyperledger Fabric é o seu ponto de partida.

fabric,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/fabric/pulls/105,https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/105,vikas1188,updated the doc with correct CLI default exit time,"



## Description
The default CLI exit time is 10 sec as per the configuration while following this document. & I found this as a big issue and very hard to notice and can be a big impediment for anyone who is following this doc. 
If you want to update this information by yourself, you can do it in your language. I've added the important details already as an edit to this document.

## Motivation and Context
It helps developer to know to go to correct path. CLI container was exiting the moment I was starting it, because the default time was 10 sec. If I were to knew it, I would not have wasted 4 hrs to this. I don't want anyone else to face this issue that they can just add the delay while using the ``./byfn.sh`` script.


Fixes #

## How Has This Been Tested?
It is just a doc update.

The repository is full of `gofmt`  issues.

## Description

This changeset is autofix of all `gofmt` issues.

## Motivation and Context

Editing the code with an editor integrated with `gofmt` produced extra changes, not related to the intent of the task. For clarity in future pull-requests, the gofmt issues should be solved once and for all.

## How Has This Been Tested?

`make checks` has been run

This change doesn't break the code, because it uses official `gofmt` to do the auto code formatting.

fabric,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/fabric/pulls/52,https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/52,3rdstage,Update ca-setup.rst - specifying CA name,"As of Fabric CA v1.0.0-alpha2, Fabric CA client accessing Fabric CA server which has explicit CA name should provide the name using ``--caname`` option.
.

## Description
If a ``fabric-ca-client`` accessing Fabric CA server which was started with explicit CA name specified by ``--ca.name`` option of ``fabric-ca-server`` command, doesn't provide the CA name using ``--caname`` option, it would get an error with the following message

>  Error: Error response from server was: CA '' does not exist

## Motivation and Context

## How Has This Been Tested?
I started CA server with the following command,

<pre>
fabric-ca-server start -b admin:admin1234 \
--debug \
--port 7054 \
--registry.maxenrollments 0 \
--ca.name ca0 &>>$FABRIC_CA_SERVER_HOME/fabric-ca.log & \

</pre>

When I tried to enroll ``admin``, using the following command, I got error message ``Error: Error response from server was: CA '' does not exist``
<pre>
fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:admin1234@localhost:7054
</pre>

But I retried to enroll ``admin`` with ``--caname`` option, I got success
<pre>
fabric-ca-client enroll -u http://admin:admin1234@localhost:7054 --caname ca0
</pre>

## Description
I have added a link to an interaction diagram we have created. This explains the HL Fabric security related work flow at various entities. If this is not the suitable place to link the diagram, please suggest the appropriate place. Thanks.

## Motivation and Context
Based on the discussion in the mail chain <https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2017-April/000759.html>, I am adding this diagram. Please see whether it helps the users or chaincode developers to understand the flow.

## How Has This Been Tested?
We have created this diagram based on our exploration of HL Fabric over an year.

## Description
CC can getStates from peer and putState to peer by batch, it can reduce network traffic.

## Motivation and Context
1、for example,getState by list a,b,c,d, e ,i need to call getState some times
2、for example,setState by list a->10,b->20,c->30,d->40, e->50 ,i also need to call putState some times
**Now only need to call once by batch**
## How Has This Been Tested?
examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example06 which is a new example using **getStates and putSates**

## Checklist:
- [] i had modified protos/peer/chaincode_shim.proto ,and make protos to generate `chaincode_shim.pb.go`
**add three**
GetStateQueryInfo -- used as payload of ChaincodeMessage Type  GET_STATE 
GetStateResultInfo--  the response of getStates ,payload of ChaincodeMessage Type  RESPONSE
GetStateValue      ---  the value of bytes
**modify one**
PutStateInfo          --  the repeated key and value
- []  i had added GetStates and PutStates in core/chaincode/shim/interface.go
- []  i had modify the  implement the ChaincodeStub and mokestub ,

During the concurrency process of invoke and query, the gRPC service flow breaks in the chaincode module, resulting in an ERROR of “transport is closing” reported. And an exception “concurrent map read and map write” would be thrown in shim layer.
 
In the structs of Handler in shim, there is a variable “isTransaction” of type Map. This variable adds writing locks when taking inserting and deleting operation, while it does not add locks during the query operation, which results in exceptions thrown in the concurrency process of read and write. And writing locks are added in all the structs with type Map in the Handler of the chaincodes.

The solution to this problem is to add writing locks in the inserting and deleting operation and add reading locks in the query operation, during the operation of structs with type Map in the Handler in chaincode and shim.

Hi there,

This week a new version of the [uuid](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) module got released. The old module which was available by the name [node-uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-uuid) got deprecated and will show error message upon every install of the module.

To get rid of those install errors I've created this **automated pull request**. I've run some checks against your code base to test whether you're using one of the [deprecated apis](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid/commit/5ae7287fc935eb55ef39133e4be17ef623ca000e), but this isn't the case.


Please test the changes against your code. I didn't run any tests and therefore can't guarantee that it isn't breaking. You can also just close this pr if you don't want to update your module.

In case there's already another pr open to upgrade uuid, I'm sorry for the effort I'm causing.",[],1,2016-11-23 02:32:43,2016-11-23 22:09:01,2016-11-23 22:09:03,False,,,dirty,False,closed
