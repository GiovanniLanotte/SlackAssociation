The easy way of introducing that type of bug is to use async await in your app without surrounding the call with a try catch block. There is no other way to trap errors thrown by fabric in the node SDK if you like the async await programming model.

 

The other possibility is that you are catching a race condition by talking to fabric from another thread after the channel is known but before the config block is committed. That too would be a bug since you clearly must wait for confirmation that the operation is complete at the client app that created the channel.

/**
 * <h1>""Hello world"" Chaincode</h1>
 *<b> Features:</b>
 *
 *<li> - in addition to framework-propagated (put\del\query) functions
 * also provides no-op function ""hello"" so it could be invoked without executing stub code  @see shim.ChaincodeStub
 * <li>- query will greet you regardless if argument found in the map, but if found it will be personal greeting
 * <li>- put and del work as you would expect for Map implementation
 *
 * <h2>Meant as default java Chaincode implementation e.g. invoked by default and required no init\prep work to check finctionality</h2>
 * steps to invoke chaincode functions in dev mode:
 * <li>1. run node in dev mode e.g.:
 'export CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug
 ./peer node start --peer-chaincodedev'
 *<li>2.  run chaincode e.g. via gradle:
 'gradle run'
 *<li>3. Now we can communicate to chaincode via peer:
 <br>
 <code>
 ./peer chaincode deploy -n hello -c '{""Function"":""init"",""Args"":[]}'<br>
 ./peer chaincode query -n hello -c '{""Function"":""put"",""Args"":[""Me""]}'<br>
 - get you argument echo back if not found  in the map <br><br>
 ./peer chaincode invoke -n hello -c '{""Function"":""hello"",""Args"":[""""]}'<br>
 - no-op test. invoke chaincode, but  not ChaincodeStub @see shim.ChaincodeStub, Handler @see shim.Handler
 hence no channel call and only effect is line in stdout<br><br>
 ./peer chaincode invoke -n hello -c '{""Function"":""put"",""Args"":[""hey"",""me""]}'<br>
 - put your name on the map<br><br>
 ./peer chaincode query -n hello -c '{""Function"":""put"",""Args"":[""hey""]}'<br>
 - get you argument echo back if not found  in the map<br><br>
 ./peer chaincode query -n hello -c '{""Function"":""put"",""Args"":[""hey""]}'<br>
 - personal greeting for mapped name<br>

Yes, I agree. This needs much more work!

BTW: Just for context: *while good cryptographic hash functions are deterministic, quick to compute and have the additional properties of being collision resistant and pre-image and second-pre-image resistant... they are designed to provide/guarantee integrity and not necessarily secrecy or confidentiality*.

So, I'm with you - these hashes are not used just for further data obfuscation [or ""should not be used for data obfuscation"", I hope? ;-)]

Also, what's ""SHA0-256"" ?
