sawtooth-explorer,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-explorer/pulls/3,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-explorer/pull/3,GiniH,Fix Angular CLI dependency version,"An ""emergency patch"" to the angular devkit broke several builds of angular-cli. As a result, when trying to run the `sawtooth-explorer` project with `ng serve` for the first time after installing dependencies, users were getting the following error in output:

`Error: Cannot find module '@angular-devkit/core'`

This MR updates angular-cli to apply their fix for this, and changes the dependency to allow for patches and minor updates. It also updates the `dev_setup` script so that the global version of `angular-cli` installed will match the project version. Last, the `typescript` dependency has been changed so that it will meet the required version range for `angular-cli`.
