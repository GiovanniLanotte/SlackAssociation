Glad to find a dockerfile to help jump in and testing this out. Could you add a docker-compose.yml file as well to see how this integrates with the rest of the sawtooth stack? Any other environment variables that need to be handled other that what I see with `SAWTOOTH_REST_API` in the entrypoint, or startup service dependencies before launch?",2018-04-07 02:10:09,2018-04-07 02:10:09

I needed to run Explorer in a Docker container without relying on Docker Compose, so I created these files and figured I might as well contribute them to the community.

Although locking versions does create more stable builds, it also creates a situation where we would be using old stale software dependencies; if this goes on long enough, it can be hard to upgrade to new versions later (because it has to be done all at once).

We mitigate this in a couple ways: a) promptly fix issues as they come up, so we solve one problem at a time; b) do nightly builds so we can detect breakage even if there was no PR activity.  Of course, none of that helps if upstream dependencies are actually broken.",2018-02-27 14:43:39,2018-02-27 14:43:39

I've undone the dependencies version lockdown and kept the updated angular-cli version to fix the original issue, plus allowed for patches and minor version updates to it so that if this happens again we'll catch the patch.",2018-02-27 16:55:09,2018-02-27 16:55:09
