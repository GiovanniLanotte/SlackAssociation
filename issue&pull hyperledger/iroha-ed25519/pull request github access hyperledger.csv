- [x] add hunter to ed25519 - this allows us to import openssl / gtest / benchmark easily on any platform; and make reproducible builds. This step was necessary before hunterization of this package.
- [x] add `bcryptgenrandom` random number generator for Windows
- [x] remove `amd64-64-24k` (without PIC) - it does not add value to the codebase
- [x] add appveyor integration for Windows CI
- [x] throw away `generate_export_header`, replace with manually written header. Add export keyword for exported C methods.
- [x] add `sha2_sphlib` implementation
