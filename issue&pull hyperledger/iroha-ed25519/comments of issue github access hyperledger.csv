MySQLclient merges few static libraries into single one with https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/5.7/cmake/libutils.cmake. And it is portable solution. I did not try this one, I can't highlight problems.

We define our own cmake `ed25519_add_library`, which creates static library and enables `-fPIC`. Then, we merge static libraries into single shared `libed25519.so`. For all targets we define `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL=ON` if `TESTING=ON`. 

This may satisfy requirements of both clients. ",2018-04-03 11:07:09,2018-04-03 11:10:38

Quite messed up with the naming when I was trying to compile with mingw, it still produces the `libed25519.so.1.3.00` file, instead of `ed25519.dll` or smth like that. Although it is dll inside as intended",2018-04-03 15:11:46,2018-04-03 15:11:58
