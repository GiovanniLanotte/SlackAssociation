you would need to check out the repo here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/homebrew-fabric and make your edits, pushing them to gerrit

https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/1.1.0/collaboration/code/gerrit_accounts.html

feel free to ask on rocket.chat - https://chat.hyperledger.org/ - discuss in #fabric

one note: when you set up your LFID do not use social logins the first time, create the account and you can add social logins later",2017-07-13 20:33:36,2017-07-13 20:33:36
