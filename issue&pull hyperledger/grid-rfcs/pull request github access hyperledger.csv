grid-rfcs,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pulls/5,https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/5,adeebahmed,Add RFC for Grid Product,This RFC proposes a GS1-compatible implementation of Product for Grid. The component is intended to initially cover food items in accordance to the GS1 spec. The intention is to iterate on this product component to include more product types in the future.,['agunde406'],4,2019-03-25 21:46:52,,2019-03-26 19:56:21,False,,,blocked,True,open

grid-rfcs,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pulls/2,https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/2,chenette,Add README.md contents for grid-rfcs repo,"Adapted the sawtooth-rfcs README.md (which is based on the Rust RFCs README)
with appropriate changes for Hyperledger Grid, including:

- Added ""opening"" content that describes what this repo is, with a link to the
  Hyperledger Grid website

- Changed the subteam section to describe the current situation (root team only)
  and to summarize how to propose and create a subteam

- Added new links, fixed broken links, and updated inter-file anchors

- Fixed egregious errors, confusion, and punctuation problems.

  For example, the original README says RFCs that *DO* ""demonstrate understanding
  of the impact of the design"" are ""likely to be poorly received.""
