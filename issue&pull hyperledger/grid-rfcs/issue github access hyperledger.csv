grid-rfcs,chenette,https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/2,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/issues/2,Add README.md contents for grid-rfcs repo,"Adapted the sawtooth-rfcs README.md (which is based on the Rust RFCs README)
with appropriate changes for Hyperledger Grid, including:

- Added ""opening"" content that describes what this repo is, with a link to the
  Hyperledger Grid website

- Changed the subteam section to describe the current situation (root team only)
  and to summarize how to propose and create a subteam

- Added new links, fixed broken links, and updated inter-file anchors

- Fixed egregious errors, confusion, and punctuation problems.

  For example, the original README says RFCs that *DO* ""demonstrate understanding
  of the impact of the design"" are ""likely to be poorly received.""
