sawtooth-marketplace,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-marketplace/pulls/64,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-marketplace/pull/64,delventhalz,Add automatic daily offers to admin CLI,"Adds two commands to the admin cli:

**Command:** `mktadm renew`

Similar to `seed` (formerly known as `submit`), `renew` takes a url and a data file and submits data to the REST API. Specifically, it will submit any `RENEWABLE` Offers, after first closing any open offers that match. This effectively resets rules like `EXCHANGE_ONCE_PER_ACCOUNT`.

**Usage:**

```
bin/mktadm renew -u localhost:8040 -d sawbuck_app/app_data.yaml
```

**Command:** `mktadm schedule`

Uses `cron` to execute other `mktadm` commands on a regular schedule. Can be run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. Resubmitting the same command (with the same parameters), will reschedule it. Can also use the `--remove`flag to unschedule a command.

**Usage**
```
bin/mktadm schedule -H ""renew -u localhost:8040 -d sawbuck_app/app_data.yaml""
bin/mktadm schedule -D ""renew -u localhost:8040 -d sawbuck_app/app_data.yaml""
bin/mktadm schedule --remove ""renew -u localhost:8040 -d sawbuck_app/app_data.yaml""
```

You can check your existing cron jobs using:
```
crontab -l
```

Or remove them with:
```
crontab -r
