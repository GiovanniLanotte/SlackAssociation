With only the default options enables, the PlantUML output shows inheritance (e.g. `AddCar` inherits from `Transaction`, `Car` inherits from `Vehicle`) and so on. Would there be any interest in adding more information and relationships to these diagrams? 

I've hacked on my own version of the extension to add additional information for relationships and concepts inside transactions, assets, etc. My goal has been to get a better image of the relationships of the various entities in use within the blockchain.

As a tiny example, the following CTO file:
```
namespace org.example

transaction AddCar {
  o String model
  o String year
}

transaction RemoveCar {
  --> Car car
}

asset Vehicle identified by registration {
  o String registration
}

asset Car extends Vehicle {
  o String model
  o String year
}
```
might be visualized to include the relationship from `RemoveCar --> Car` as

Is this something you would be interested in merging into the extension? I realize that since the way things are visualized might often be up to individual preference, it might be difficult to find something that can fit all users, but I'd be glad to discuss this further if there is interest.",closed,False,2018-10-30 09:57:22,2018-11-13 08:29:59

Updating the plugin to support this would be very useful, not least because these imports don't make any assumptions about local files, or whether they have been opened in the editor.

Code to be updated is here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-vscode-plugin/blob/master/server/src/server.ts#L367

The basic approach is to:

1. Call `addModelFile(s)/updateModelFile(s)`, but disable validation: https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/master/packages/composer-common/lib/modelmanager.js#L149
2. Call `updateExternalModels` https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/master/packages/composer-common/lib/modelmanager.js#L308 which will download external dependencies over the network into the `ModelManager`

A good source of models for testing with external dependencies is https://models.accordproject.org

## Context
Reported on Rocket chat by jdockter

## Expected Behavior
It should work the same on all platforms

## Actual Behavior
Error checking works, but the colour highlighting does not.

## Possible Fix
There is a type in the syntax file name that needs fixing.

## Steps to Reproduce
Open a permissions.acl file on Ubuntu and you will not get syntax highlighting like you do on other platforms for acl files.

## Existing issues
None

## Context
