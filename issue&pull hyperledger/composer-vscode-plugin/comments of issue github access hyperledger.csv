It is not quite true that for _all_ errors the whole file is highlighted. In fact exceptions thrown by the underlying composer parser may have a Line/Column number in them or not. If they do, then only the error is highlighted, whereas if they do not then the whole file is highlighted as the location is not known - see examples below and unfortunately, I have to rely on the base parser to locate the error for highlighting.

However, I hear your pain over this it hits me too and to fix this the underlying composer parser needs to issue file and line numbers for more errors. I raised issue #321 on base composer on this for a particular cto exception, and also base issue #382 is open which covers this for ACL files. So let's keep this issue open but blocked until the underlying base defects are fixed, then we can see where we are. I also suggest you comment on these base issues, to raise their priority in the composer team
