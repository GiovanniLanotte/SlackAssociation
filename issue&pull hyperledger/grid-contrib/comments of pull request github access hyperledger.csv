+The grid-contrib repository contains contributed software for
+[Hyperledger Grid](https://grid.hyperledger.org), a framework for building
+supply chain solutions for blockchain platforms.
+
+This repository is intended for community-contributed software, including
+example middleware tools and reference implementations for smart contracts
+(also called ""transaction families""). This software is designed to work with
+the Hyperledger Grid platform software in the [grid
+repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid).
+
+For example, the Grid Track and Trace transaction family provides an off-chain
+smart contract that tracks goods as they move through a supply chain. For more
+information, see the [Grid Track and Trace
+documentation](https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/grid/nightly/master/family_specification.html)
+and the
+[grid/track_and_trace](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/tree/master/track_and_trace)

https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/pull/5,https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/pull/5,"@davececchi - How does ""including example domain models and smart contracts"" sound?  

Or would you keep the ""reference implementations"" piece?  I.e., ""including example domain models and reference implementations for smart contracts""?

A third option would be to drop ""example"": ""including domain models and {reference implementations of} smart contracts"".
