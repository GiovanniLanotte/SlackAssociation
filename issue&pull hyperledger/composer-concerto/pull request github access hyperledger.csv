## Issue/User story
A possible fix for issue #27 based on moment.js as a DateTime representation

## Design of the fix

The fix switches internal representation for values validated through CTO models to Moment, rather than JavaScript Date.

Moment objects are created in a way which preserves the original timezone offset if present (using `Moment.parseZone`) during deserialization.

Moment objects are serialized back to an ISO8601 string with the original timezone offset preserved.

Timestamps when not present during validation are always created in the UTC timezone.

## Automated Tests

All tests have been migrated to the new representation, and a new serialization test checks for the timezone offset preservation.
