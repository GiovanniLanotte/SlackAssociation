## Context

`mkdirp` appears as a `devDependency` but is needed at runtime in the filewriter.

## Expected Behavior

One should be able to install and use composer-concerto without adding `mkdirp` as a dependency themselves.

## Actual Behavior

If installing composer-concerto without adding `mkdirp` manually, node.js complains of a missing module.

## Possible Fix

Move `mkdirp` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in the `package.json`

## Steps to Reproduce

## Issue/User story
A possible fix for issue #27 based on moment.js as a DateTime representation

## Design of the fix

The fix switches internal representation for values validated through CTO models to Moment, rather than JavaScript Date.

Moment objects are created in a way which preserves the original timezone offset if present (using `Moment.parseZone`) during deserialization.

Moment objects are serialized back to an ISO8601 string with the original timezone offset preserved.

Timestamps when not present during validation are always created in the UTC timezone.

## Automated Tests

All tests have been migrated to the new representation, and a new serialization test checks for the timezone offset preservation.

## Context
Using Concerto for data models with DateTime values in specific timezones

## Expected Behavior
Deserialization/serialization should preserve the original timezone.

## Actual Behavior
Deserialization/serialization shifts all dates to `Z` timezone.

## Possible Fix
Unclear what changes are needed.

## Steps to Reproduce

Some sample code, and a trace:
Model: 
```
transaction PayOut  {
  o Double totalAmount
  o DateTime dueBy
}
```
JavaScript code:
```
        const response = {
            ""$class"": ""org.accordproject.ippayment.PayOut"",
            ""totalAmount"": 77.4,
            ""dueBy"": Moment.parseZone(""2018-04-12T04:00:00-05:00"")

        const validatedResponse = template.getSerializer().fromJSON(response);

        console.log('VALIDATED:  '+JSON.stringify(validatedResponse));
        console.log('SERIALIZED: '+JSON.stringify(serializedResponse));
```

```

composer-concerto,jeromesimeon,https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-concerto/issues/26,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/composer-concerto/issues/26,Text variant annotation for model enumerations,"To support textual variants of the same enumeration element in a model, the model definition should allow annotations that enumerate text alternatives.

The annotation could also be used to capture language-specific variants of a model element.

This would clean up model enumerations so that they only need to define a single element per semantic element. Logic that operates on enumerations (for example `match` statements in Ergo) would then also not need to match multiple values

Where an annotation is not provided, the String value of the element would be used.

For example: 
```
enum TemporalUnit {
  @alternativeText('day','days','jour','jours')
  o DAY
  //...
}
```

We could even consider something like a `.language` file to externalize language definitions, e.g.
```
enum TemporalUnit {
  @languageKey('DAY')
  o DAY
  //...
}
```
and in `model.en.language`
```json
{
  ""DAY"": [""day"", ""days""]
}
```

- [ ] Agree on annotation keyword (`alternative`, `alternativeText`, `verbalization`, `localization`, `textOptions` etc..)
- [ ] Research existing ways to describe locale variants, e.g. Message Resource Property files in Java, [Unicode CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-json) etc.
