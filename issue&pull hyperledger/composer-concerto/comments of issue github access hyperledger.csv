Here is a more detailed analysis of the listed dependencies in both `composer-concerto` and `composer-concerto-tools`:

**Composer Concerto:**

In dependencies, and used in `./lib`:

```
    ""axios"": ""0.18.0"",
    ""debug"": ""4.0.1"",
    ""lodash.padstart"": ""4.6.1"",
    ""lorem-ipsum"": ""1.0.6"",
    ""npm-paths"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""urijs"": ""1.19.1"",
    ""mkdirp"": ""0.5.1"",
    ""moment-mini"": ""2.22.1"",
    ""uuid"": ""3.3.2""
```

*** Not in dependencies, but used in `./lib`:

```
    ""acorn"": ""5.1.2"",
    ""commander"": ""2.18.0"",
    ""doctrine"": ""2.1.0"",
    ""fs-extra"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""node-plantuml"": ""0.7.0"",
    ""semver"": ""5.5.1"",
    ""yargs"": ""12.0.2""
```

**Composer Concerto Tools:**

In dependencies, and used in `./lib`:

```
    ""composer-concerto"": ""0.60.1"",
    ""debug"": ""4.1.0"",
    ""mkdirp"": ""0.5.1"",
```

*** In dependencies, but not used in `./lib`:

```
    ""axios"": ""0.18.0"",
    ""commander"": ""2.19.0"",
    ""doctrine"": ""2.1.0"",
    ""fs-extra"": ""7.0.0"",
    ""lodash.padstart"": ""4.6.1"",
    ""lorem-ipsum"": ""1.0.6"",
    ""moment"": ""2.22.2"",
    ""npm-paths"": ""1.0.0"",
    ""semver"": ""5.6.0"",
    ""urijs"": ""1.19.1"",
    ""uuid"": ""3.3.2"",
    ""yargs"": ""12.0.2""
```

A possible resolution could be:
1. Remove unneeded dependencies in Composer Concerto Tools
2. Add needed dependencies in Composer Concerto

@dselman : I would be happy to work on PRs for that on both projects, but could use some review/guidance.

A few additional notes:
- Different versions for ""debug"" in composer concerto & tools, use the more recent? (""debug"": ""4.1.0"")
- Unclear whether some of the code in composer-concerto/lib/tools is really used at runtime

About the second point about `lib/tools`: when looking at the dependencies, `yargs` and `node-plantuml` only show up in `lib/tools` which AFAICT is only used in `./test` but isn't exposed in the main index. I wasn't sure if those tools were being used or could be moved to testing (and the corresponding dependencies could go to `devDependencies`.

I won't tackle that part unless I hear otherwise.

enum TemporalUnit {

  o DAY

}

With the second key (plural) optional.

Note that in its current state Composer doesn't support multiple decorators with the same name on the same element. 

Also, note that while an external localization file would be very nice for translation purposes it would be tricky to make it work with models that are loaded from URLs.",2018-12-06 16:31:08,2018-12-06 16:31:08
