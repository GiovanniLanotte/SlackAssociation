Libindy `pack` function in the current implementation builds JSON object and then does a conversion to bytes.
- Setting bytes as is to A2A `msg` field is super inefficient because of the following message JSON serialization.
- Applying additional base64 wrapping increase message size also

Solution: There the next possible options:
- converting the object back from bytes (as I suggested in PR) before setting as a value
- converting bytes to string some simple way
- changing of `pack` function to return JSON string instead of conversion to bytes.

As discussed in the HIPE [0025-indy-docs-framework](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0025-indy-docs-framework/README.md) we would like to have a centralized site for our documentation. The changes I have made are outlined in that HIPE. 

I've added the following files:
- `conf.py`  - used to build the documentation with sphinx
- `Makefile` - proves users a way to build and test the sphinx docs locally
- `text/index.rst` - specifies the menu structure for readthedocs

I've changed the following things:
- Changed the `0000-template.md` and all of the current hipes to have only 1 `<h1>` header. This is an unfortunate requirement of readthedocs to autogenerate the sidebar list of all the pages as specified in the `index.rst`. I've changed them to increase by a depth of 1 for every layer deeper they go. 
- Changed every HIPE's `<h1>` title to be the HIPE number and name in the following way: `0025-indy-docs-framework --> 0025: Indy Docs Framework`
- Minor punctuation edits found during the review of the hipes.

There has been a lot of discussion on the subject and this is an initial proposal to help document what is needed to be supported in Indy and how it will work practice with use cases. Hope the draft is clear but if any further clarification that is needed before being accepted let me know. Eventually a sequence diagram and demo will be created to further support the draft.
