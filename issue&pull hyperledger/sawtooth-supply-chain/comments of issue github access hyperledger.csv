It is unclear why you are making that change. It doesn't appear to be ""broken"", but a behavior change.

Thanks @peterschwarz for pointing it out. I have excluded that commit altogether. The intent in the commit was to fix the filters on all the pages that display a list of asset/agent/fish. But the fix was disabling the refresh also. Refresh is what causes the issue itself. Will take some more time to have a flawless fix to this and raise a separate PR later.",2019-02-22 15:38:03,2019-02-23 05:29:53
