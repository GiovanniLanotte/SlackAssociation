If set to true, `fixed` designates that a property may _only_ have a value set at record creation. Any updates to property values submitted afterwards will be rejected by the transaction processor.

Besides giving more control to property schema design, this will be an important clue to a universal client. For example, with a fish record type, _species_ would be fixed. A create record form would provide a field to submit a species value, but it would _not_ allow reporters to be authorized for the field.

Indeed, no Supply Chain implementation has, opting to instead use INTs with a hard-coded conversion rate (for example, millionths).

This PR formalizes that practice by removing FLOATs entirely, and giving INTs a new piece of metadata: ""exponent"". This refers to the exponent used in scientific notation. So for example an integer with an exponent of `-6` would be millionths of a whole unit (i.e. 10 ^ -6). Note that this does not actually affect any of the math done by the Transaction Processor, but will allow clients to properly interpret these numbers without relying on hard coded logic.

This will allow properties to be created with a limited set of valid string values, stored as integers. These valid `enum_options` are defined first in the `PropertySchema`, and later copied to the `Property`, where they are stored and referenced during updates. Later data type expansions will use this same pattern, referencing metadata stored on the `Property` to validate and complete an update.

Updates the ledger-sync to pull `enum_options` so enum values will be stored locally as their string name rather than their integer value, which matches how protobuf enums are stored.

sawtooth-supply-chain,delventhalz,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/pull/16,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/issues/16,Standardize server config with sensible defaults,"In order to ease deployment, all server configuration has been centralized. The server will first look for environment variables. If those are missing it will pull config values from a `config.json` file, of which an example has been provided. If a needed config variable has not been set in either location, a sensible default has been hard coded in.

For example, the server's `PRIVATE_KEY` could be set with an environment variable:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 node index.js
```

Through `config.json`:
```
{
  ""PRIVATE_KEY"": ""1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111""
}
```

Or omitted entirely, and the server will automatically default to `""1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111""`.

An important exception is the Google Maps API Key. This _has no default_. Instead, if unset, the first user attempting to use a Map through the browser will be prompted to sign up for and enter an API Key. This key will be saved to `config.json`.

This does not update `run_tests`, `run_docker_tests`, `run_lint`, or `run_bandit`. The deployment process will also be streamlined in future PRs.

To run, download the repo, and from the project directory:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then in a new process:
```bash
./bin/protogen
docker exec -it sawtooth-client-default bash
```

This will enter the sawtooth client container which has the `sawtooth_sdk` in the PYTHONPATH, which the transaction processor needs. So from within that container:
```bash
cd sawtooth-supply-chain/
./bin/transaction-processor
```

Open one more process:
```bash
cd client/
npm install
npm run build
cd ../server/
npm install
npm run init
npm run make-fish
curl localhost:8008/batches -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/octet-stream"" --data-binary @fish.batch 
npm start
```
