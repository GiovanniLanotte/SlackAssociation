Indeed, no Supply Chain implementation has, opting to instead use INTs with a hard-coded conversion rate (for example, millionths).

This PR formalizes that practice by removing FLOATs entirely, and giving INTs a new piece of metadata: ""exponent"". This refers to the exponent used in scientific notation. So for example an integer with an exponent of `-6` would be millionths of a whole unit (i.e. 10 ^ -6). Note that this does not actually affect any of the math done by the Transaction Processor, but will allow clients to properly interpret these numbers without relying on hard coded logic.

The server will first look for environment variables. If those are missing it will pull config values from a `config.json` file, of which an example has been provided. If a needed config variable has not been set in either location, a sensible default has been hard coded in.

For example, the server's `PRIVATE_KEY` could be set with an environment variable:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 node index.js
```

Through `config.json`:
```
{
  ""PRIVATE_KEY"": ""1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111""
}
```

Or omitted entirely, and the server will automatically default to `""1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111""`.

An important exception is the Google Maps API Key. This _has no default_. Instead, if unset, the first user attempting to use a Map through the browser will be prompted to sign up for and enter an API Key. This key will be saved to `config.json`.

```bash
