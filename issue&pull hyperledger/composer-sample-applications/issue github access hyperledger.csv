But when I used the default admin@letters-of-credit business network card to connect via node-red & the hyperledger-composer-out node, I get an error connecting...

""Error: creating resource error Error trying login and get user Context. Error: Error trying to enroll user or load channel configuration. Error: Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND ca.org1.example.com ca.org1.example.com:7054]""

Ask: Does anyone know how to get node-red to connect to hyperledger using this LOC sample?

I am using bnaadmin.card card
cardName: 'admin@letters-of-credit-network'
Playground v0.20.5

Expected Behavior
node-red should be able to connect to the local instance of hyperledger and create a new participant or Asset.

Using the composer GUI, logged in as admin@letters-of-credit, I can successfully create & delete both a new Participant and a new Asset, and view these as new transactions.

Actual Behavior
node-red is not able to connect to the local instance of hyperledger and cannot create a new participant or Asset.

Must do:
1. Update the scss to actually use variables
2. General clean-up of the code:
    - Improve the file structure
    - Reduce duplication of code
    - Consistent state handling - Redux is currently only used in the LOC screen and should be used throughout the app

Nice to haves:
1. Add ""suggest changes"" functionality to allow users to edit the rules
2. Add the ability to upload real invoices and evidence
3. Logos for each of the banks
4. Enhance the docs possibly add a tutorial view similar to the one the vehicle manufacture demo has 
4. Integration points with other apps?

# Changes made
## General 
- Changed vehicle-lifecycle naming to vehicle-manufacture
- Configured applications for running in iframes

## Installer
- Updated references to vehicle-lifecycle-network business network to be vehicle-manufacture-network
- Updated flows.json to remove previous Node-RED implementation and replaced it with a solution that listens for an UpdateOrderStatusEvent and sends and email if status is updated to delivery, the user paul has an email set and the user of the demo has configured the send email node. 
- Added install for using fabric v1.1 which installs against composer <span>@</span>next
- Install now listens for an environment variable of DEMO_FABRIC_VERSION if unset it defaults to fabric 1.0 and composer <span>@</span>latest, if set to hlfv11 it uses fabric 1.1 and composer <span>@</span>next

## Car builder
- Updated config to include reference to the REST server details
- Updated app.js to return the JSON config unless the environment variable REST_SERVER_CONFIG is set with the REST server details.
- Updated building screen to show tick when selecting trim and extra options
- Updated building screen to prevent submission without filling in trim, colour and interior details for the car
- Updated building screen to submit PlaceOrder transaction to REST server
- Updated PlaceOrder request format to reflect changes in the business network
- Updated status screen to listen to websockets coming from the REST server

## Manufacturing
- Updated config to include reference to the REST server details
- Added app.set to server/app.js that stores value from config file or if set the environment variable REST_SERVER_CONFIG
- Updated websocket in server/app.js to prevent app death on disconnection from remote and set it to use the config set so that it listens to the REST server for events
- Removed vehicles and transactions endpoints.
- Added orders endpoint to retrieve PlaceOrder transactions using the REST server and combine with retrieved UpdateOrderStatus transactions to handle that order assets no longer store an array of the updates placed on them
- Added updateOrderStatus endpoint to submit UpdateOrderStatus transactions via the REST server
- Updated dashboard controller loading of statusUpdates to handle the way they are returned by the orders endpoint
- Updated dashboard controller to use a single websocket for all events
- Updated updating of order status' in dashboard controller to use updateOrderStatus endpoint

## VDA
- Updated config to include reference to the REST server details
- Added app.set to server/app.js that stores value from config file or if set the environment variable REST_SERVER_CONFIG
- Updated websocket in server/app.js to prevent app death on disconnection from remote and set it to use the config set so that it listens to the REST server for events
- Removed suspicious vehicles page
- Removed suspicious vehicles number from header
- Updated dashboard controller to work with v0.17.0 and remove composer events from VDA list e.g. AddUser.
- Updated daashboard controller to display the identities involved in the transaction correctly by name rather than using hard coded defaults
- Updated to use a single websocket to listen for events coming from the REST server

# Relies upon
- [ ] vehicle-manufacture-network being created as a sample in http://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks
- [ ] install will only function if docker image released using new vehicle-manufacture naming
- [ ] hlfv11 installer's node red flow relies on updated composer node red modules available <span>@</span>next

Linked from https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/1500

## Context
The queryNative has been removed in api and this has broken the vehicle life cycle query flow demo  .


## Expected Behavior
The expected behavior should find out the specified colour of the vehicle. 

## Actual Behavior
When making a query, it has got an error as below:
The sg : string[128]
""error trying invoke chaincode. Error: chaincode error (status: 500, message: ReferenceError: identifier 'queryNative' undefined)""

## Possible Fix
temp fix is to put the initial queryNative API back or wait for an update with the new query methods.

This participant, and other aspects of insurance are not currently modelled/implemented in the sample.  This issue covers extending the models and network code to support the Insurer.  I'm proposing the provision of an application for the insurer be covered by a separate issue as it is not required in order to extend the business network for the Insurer and can be added later.

I'm happy to provide pull requests for the above but would appreciate feedback on ideas before I commit too much to code.  I'll add thoughts as comments to this issue and any input would be greatly appreciated.  Many thanks.
Below are my thoughts on changes to the Vehicle Lifecycle sample model to support the Insurer participant.  Comments would be appreciated.

## vehicle.cto

Create a Company type of Insurer (analogous to the ScrapMerchant)

```
participant Insurer extends Company {
}
```

## vda.cto

Define the details required for insurance.

- the insurance company
- the policyNumber
- the expiry date (last valid date)
- the timestamp (is this the timestamp for when the things was created in blockchain or outside blockchain?  I'm thinking it's the former)

```
concept InsuranceDetails {
  --> Insurer insurer
  o String policyNumber
  o Date expiry
  o DateTime timestamp
}
```

Add InsuranceDetails to the Vehicle asset.  I considered having it on VehicleDetails but I think that concept is purely about describing the car.

```
asset Vehicle identified by vin {
  o String vin
  o VehicleDetails vehicleDetails
  o VehicleStatus vehicleStatus
  o InsuranceDetails insuranceDetails optional
  --> Person owner optional
  o String numberPlate optional
  o String suspiciousMessage optional
  o VehicleTransferLogEntry[] logEntries optional
}
```

A transaction to update the vehicle with Insurance information (analogous to ScrapVehicle).  I included the ""logEntries"" because it was in ScrapVehicle, but I don't understand how it is meant to be used.  Is this useful and if so, how is it used?

```
transaction InsureVehicle extends VehicleTransaction {
  o VehicleTransaction[] logEntries optional
}
```

composer-sample-applications,mhart,https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-applications/issues/3,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/composer-sample-applications/issues/3,npm install fails for non-localhost docker,"If you don't have docker running directly on `localhost` (eg if you're communicating with a virtual machine, using [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/), etc) then the `npm install` step will just wait infinitely at the `while ! nc localhost 7051 </dev/null; do sleep 1; done` step.

If those references are changed, the following error will occur later in the install process:

There doesn't appear to be any way around this via configuration as it's hardcoded in a number of places, but here's how to get it to work:

1. replace the three instances of `localhost` with your docker host IP (eg, `192.168.99.100`) in `scripts/start-hyperledger.sh`
1. remove/comment out the `rm -rf ~/.composer-connection-profiles/defaultProfile/*` line in `scripts/download-hyperledger.sh`
1. create a `~/.composer-connection-profiles/defaultProfile/connection.json` file with the following content, replacing `<DOCKER_IP>` with your docker host IP (eg, `192.168.99.100`) and `<HOME_DIR>` with the absolute path to your home directory (eg, `/Users/michael`):

```json
{
  ""type"": ""hlf"",
  ""membershipServicesURL"": ""grpc://<DOCKER_IP>:7054"",
  ""peerURL"": ""grpc://<DOCKER_IP>:7051"",
  ""eventHubURL"": ""grpc://<DOCKER_IP>:7053"",
  ""keyValStore"": ""<HOME_DIR>/.composer-credentials"",
  ""deployWaitTime"": ""300"",
  ""invokeWaitTime"": ""100""
}
```

Now `npm install` (and a subsequent `npm test`) should succeed.

Not sure whether this should be documented, or the startup scripts modified to accept an env variable of some sort – but if anyone else runs into it, hopefully they'll see this issue.",closed,False,2017-02-06 21:38:47,2017-11-07 19:13:17

I'm pretty new to this project. As a matter of fact, saw it yesterday for the first time.
I have just downloaded and tried it locally, and I believe that we may need to add an extra dependency to the package.json. Though I may be wrong.

Please could you kindly take a look?
