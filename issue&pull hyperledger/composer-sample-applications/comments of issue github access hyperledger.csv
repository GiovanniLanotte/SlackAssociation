I'll remove `logEntries`.

```
transaction InsureVehicle extends VehicleTransaction {
}
```

I meant to check whether `Date` was a valid type. :)  I don't need the Time element of `DateTime`.  I've found the docs now and will change it to `DateTime`. 
`DateTime expiry` is intended to be the expiry date of the policy.  `Timestamp` was intended to record when the policy was created.  I hadn't decided whether that would be the time when it was created by the insurer or when it was added to Blockchain.  Thinking about it a bit more maybe this should be when the policy commences.  So I think I will change these to be:

```
concept InsuranceDetails {
  --> Insurer insurer
  o String policyNumber
  o DateTime policyStart
  o DateTime policyEnd
}

Many thanks for taking the time to take a look. 

Our working assumption is that the 'composer-cli' tools would have been installed globaly - so it doesn't need to be added as a dependency.  Though reading back just now on the docs we seem to have lost the important comment about doing this!

If we install this locally - some of the scripts might need to modified. .... but getting a simple getting started would be good.  Let me think on it a bit!

Will be happy to start and try from a fresh/clean set-up, so as to confirm that if one is ""doing the right thing"" (following the step-by-step instruction) - it just works.

Of course I could ""hack it"" and get it to work somehow (especially as Simon was here in SF last week) - just want(ed) to make sure that this also works for others out of the box.

Sure, either way (cli installed globally or otherwise) - please let me know when we have this documented, and I'll be happy to give it a go. HTH, J",2017-02-06 19:56:47,2017-02-06 19:56:47
