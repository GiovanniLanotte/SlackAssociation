It does appear that you have rolled in some changes to unrelated files tho - changes to vehicle-manufacturing-network. I think that is what is causing issues with the DCO sign off, as it is picking up on a commit message from another contributor (Andy Hurt)

A rebase might help with this, though since you are contributing a complete separate folder it is probably easier to create a new branch from the most recent master branch, add the folder (your sample network only), commit the change using the `-s` flag and resubmit üëç  ",2018-04-09 13:35:50,2018-04-09 13:35:50

1 Looks like some of the merges bit have gone a bit astray. It's probably possible with git-magic to do this on the current branch - but admit that I backup the changes (it's all in one folder), create a new clean branch based on master and put the changes back
2 The version of composer in use is the 0.16 branch... 0.19 is now the latest and stable.. could you update to that please?

Two things:
1. We are in the process of bumping the Node version to the latest LTS release (v8).
1. I have run `npm test` with both Node v6.11.5 and v8.9.0, and they both run fine, so it isn't clear to me the value in setting a specific Node version in a `.nvmrc`",2017-11-03 14:53:08,2017-11-03 14:53:08

I would consider the value in nvmrc as a recommandation from the project maintainers. If you say that 8.9.0 works fine, you will probably tend to recommend it.

Instead of writing this down and burry the info somewhere in the doc, having a .nmvrc file guides users. Now if a user, for any reason, wants to use another version, there are still free to do so of course.

Having the value in .nvmrc ensure (lazy) users that they use the project within specs. 
Usually, old versions of node are not supported, this is clear. My initial experience with composer was very bad, just because I used NodeJS v9.x.

With a .nvmrc file, I could have simply used 'nvm use' and I would have been within specs.",2017-11-03 15:16:04,2017-11-03 15:16:04

Maybe it is looking for the sign-off in the first commit. It may be worth trying to squash all the commits into a single commit (with the sign-off statement in the commit message) and force-pushing that to change this branch to have just a single commit for the pull request.

You might be able to achieve the squash by doing an interactive rebase on master, or by doing a `merge --squash` from this branch into a fresh one based on master. In case it helps, I've squashed all the commits from this pull request in my own branch here: [https://github.com/bestbeforetoday/composer-sample-networks/tree/shacshar-1500fix](https://github.com/bestbeforetoday/composer-sample-networks/tree/shacshar-1500fix).

The description of the integration says
> this integration will set the status to failed if commits in a Pull Request do not contain a valid Signed-off-by line

My _guess_ is that any commits included in the pull request that do not have a sign-off line will cause it to fail, and I am still seeing 9 commits associated with this pull request. What I was trying to describe above was to force-push a new commit history to the branch where you raised the pull request, so it only contains a single commit (with sign-off line) for your changes.

Alternatively you could create a new branch based on the current master and then `git merge --squash` from your working branch to get everything in a single commit on that fresh branch. Then raise a new pull request from that branch.",2017-10-17 18:19:04,2017-10-17 18:19:43
