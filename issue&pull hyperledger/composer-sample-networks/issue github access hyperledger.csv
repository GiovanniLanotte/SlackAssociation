I have been learning about the modeling code from the Model Blockchain Business Network, the  Business Logic from the JavaScript file and the ACL rules from the permissions file. Now I want to challenge myself trying to build a query that will allow manufacturers to view their own vehicles.

```
rule ManufacturerCreateVehicles {

    participant(m): ""org.acme.vehicle_network.Manufacturer""
    operation: CREATE
    resource(v): ""org.acme.vehicle_network.Vehicle""
    transaction(tx): ""org.acme.vehicle_network.UpdateOrderStatus""
    condition: (v.vehicleDetails.make.getIdentifier() == m.getIdentifier() && tx.orderStatus == ""VIN_ASSIGNED"")
    action: ALLOW
}

rule ManufacturerReadVehicles {
    description: ""Allow manufacturers to create and view their vehicles""
    participant(m): ""org.acme.vehicle_network.Manufacturer""
    operation: READ
    resource(v): ""org.acme.vehicle_network.Vehicle""

function readVehicles() {
	console.log('readVehicles');

  	var factory = getFactory();

A new sample network is proposed: a clearing house. Clearing houses represent a scenario that may be elegantly solved by the abstractions provided by Composer.

A Clearing house is a financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange (i.e., clearance) of payments, securities, or derivatives transactions. After legally-binding agreement of a trade between a buyer and a seller, the role of the clearing house is to centralize and standardize all of the steps leading up to the payment of the transaction. The purpose is to reduce the cost, settlement risk and operational risk of clearing and settling multiple transactions among multiple parties.

It is feasible to remove the central clearing house and replace the operation through a series of smart contracts, with all banking parties acting to progress the clearing of funds through interactions with a shared ledger.

## Outline

We will consider the batch clearing of inter-bank payments, with netting. The netting aspect acts to consolidate payments into fewer transfers, for instance if A owes B $1000 and B owes A $100, then A will be required to transfer $900 to B during clearing.

### Participants

BankingParticipant - a participant involved with fund transfers to/from another BankingParticipant


### Assets
TransferRequest - a request to transfer funds from one BankingParticipant to another

BatchTransferRequest - a Batch of TransferRequest assets

### Transactions
A series of Transactions will be required from all participants to move the Assets from an initial state to a complete (clearing complete/settled) state:

  - CreateBatchTransaction
  - MarkPreProcessTransferComplete
  - CompleteSettlement
  - MarkPostProcessTransferComplete

### Access Control

BankingParticipants
- Only able to view Assets (Trades) within which they are participating
- Only be able to update Asset fields that relate to them",open,False,2018-01-17 18:52:12,2018-01-29 09:35:40

In the updated sample of a unit test for a business network  the identity used to connect with is a network admin user 'admin'. 
In my unit test I try to create a new identity for my test user, then construct and import its card, and then connect to the business network with this card. As follows:
```businessNetworkConnection.issueIdentity(NS + '#' + userData.id, userData.user);
....      
var userCard = new IdCard({...});
userCard.setCredentials(credentials);
...
adminConnection.importCard(userCardName, userCard);
....
businessNetworkConnection.connect(userCardName))
...
```
However, importCard() throws an error that the identity already exists. Seems like embeddedConnectionProfile attempts to add the identity to the identities registry as part of importCard call, but it's already been added there by issueIdentity?
