Point 2: Remove video on DLT vs. Blockchain
=============================================
Remove the video, which confused students.  See Discussion forum post:
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017/discussion/forum/i4x-LinuxFoundationX-LFS171x-course-3T_2017/threads/5a78c95684452a081800089c.

Extend explanation that Blockchain is just a type of DLT by mentioning 2
other types of DLTs.

Point 3, Modified Point 4, Add missing link
================================================
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued)

3. Definition of block shouldnâ€™t be split up with mention of bitcoin
concepts in between. I put the bitcoin example after block is
explained, for better concept flow.

4. Nonce relates to the Bitcoin example, so indicate that this list of 4
pieces of metadata refer to the Bitcoin example (which continues with
the Merkle Tree section in the next slide).

Bonus: ""or a brief history of blockchain technology, please click here.""
was missing the link ""here"". Added it.

Point 5: Remove conceptual speed bump
======================================

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued): I propose
to mention that Merkle tree root will be defined on the next page, to
remove a brain speed bump for students who don't know what a Merkle tree
is.

after following the lesson, I realized I wasn't so confident I could understand the application so I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone. Learn go, and ensure I understood what was happening with the Sawtooth example.  And now that I have the example working, I believed it could be nice for people allergic to NodeJS to have a counterpart in a different language.

As of yet the features are working, if you have any recommendations to make the code cleaner, I'll be happy to implement them.

By the way, I had to commit the sawtooth_sdk as right now there is no `go get` that will easily retrieve the sdk (as opposed to fabric for instance)  because some libraries needed by the sdk are not present and must be generated by cloning their repo (cf [JIRA-STL-238](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-238)) 

Basically the equivalent of `processor/index.js` is `src/processor/main.go`  and `processor/handler.js` is `src/handler/handler.go`. The rest is the sawtooth_sdk compiled
