Thanks for the email, the issue I was facing is about the
deprecated functions ""eventhub"" I have solved it for, My point in the
meeting was to have it somewhere in the example or we should add to pull
the docker image of 1.2.0 or match it with the node SDK, it took 5-6 hours
to understand the issue which should not be the case, the only thing I want
to point out is the Docker image and node SDK should pull the version.

Best Regards,

*Ati*Senior PHP Developer

Tracy - I think you can do that when you merge the PR.

Alternatively, from what I checked with one of our devs, you could create the branch before I submit the PR.  I could then just cancel this one and redo the changes so that I can target that branch.

I would say, when we decide to merge, you try to target a new ""add-indy"" branch.  If that doesn't work, the surest way is for 

* me to cancel the PR
* you to create the branch,
* me to refork the repo, reapply the changes with new commits and then do another PR.

As I was under OSX I had to ensure I was using the right python version. Found this `npm config set python /usr/bin/python2.7`

I am wondering if it would make more sense to include this in the SDK examples directory of Hyperledger Sawtooth instead of including it in this material. Since the material in this repository was specifically for the source code covered in the edx.org LFS171x course people may expect the course to also cover the Go code.,2018-01-08 21:36:31,2018-01-08 21:36:31

Is it ok if I use the client you already wrote? 

As for this PR I would see 3 possibilities on your side:

- Reject the current PR and keep the repository as it is
- Reject the current PR and add a link as an ""additional resource"" from the course to the future example 
- Accept the PR, and put a mention to it as an example of how to do the same in Go

For example, Compose file format 3.0 was first introduced in Compose release 1.10.0, and versioned gradually in subsequent releases.""
