Here are my suggestions for improving Chapter 7 - Introduction to Hyperledger Fabric. If anyone feels strongly about any of them, please let me know in the next couple days. I plan to work on the markdown on the weekend (Oct 6-7).

1) Key Components and Transaction Flow > Transaction Flow (Step 4)
Typo: The ordering service, which is made up of a cluster of orderers, does not process transactions, smart contracts, or *maintains* the shared ledger. → maintain 

2) Key Components and Transaction Flow > What Does the MSP Do?
a) The diagram doesn’t describe the flow in the text. The diagram matches the text on the previous slide (Membership Service Provider (MSP)) better, so I propose to move it there.
b) Stretch goal, if I have time: Make a flow chart that matches the flow in the text on this slide

3) Installing Hyperledger Fabric > Installing Hyperledger Fabric Docker Images and Binaries
I got errors following these steps.  Discussion forum post by tianzhong2015 at https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017/discussion/forum/i4x-LinuxFoundationX-LFS171x-course-3T_2017/threads/5b6939f8c305ad0a19000db7 indicates that we should use version 1.2.0 to avoid the errors, and that worked for me.  
I propose to change the command to 'curl -sSL https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 | bash -s 1.2.0'

4) Installing Hyperledger Fabric > Installing Hyperledger Fabric Docker Images and Binaries
“the blue portion in the above curl command” There is no blue portion…
I propose to make https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 blue and make the word 'blue' blue, as has been done lower down the page.

5) Installing Hyperledger Fabric > Installing Hyperledger Fabric Docker Images and Binaries
I propose to change “perform the following command for each of the Docker images:” to “perform the following command for each of the Fabric docker images"" because, if you just did Chapter 6, you would have all the sawtooth images too & we don't mean for them to also tag those as latest.

6) Installing Hyperledger Fabric > Installing Hyperledger Fabric Docker Images and Binaries
“$ docker tag hyperledger/fabric-tools:x86_64-1.0.2 hyperledger/fabric-tools:latest”  I think there needs to be 2 red portions (both 'fabric-tools'), but just 1 is red.
I propose to make the second 'fabric-tools' red.

7) Installing Hyperledger Fabric > Installing Hyperledger Fabric
First, the previous slide caused fabric-samples to be cloned already.  Second, you should cd into fabric-samples before you do the $PWD because you want fabric-samples/bin, but you don’t even need to do that because byfn.sh takes care of it for you on line 31.  
I propose to just delete this slide entirely.

8) Writing an Application > Getting Started (Part II)
‘node registerAdmin.js’ fails with syntax error.  Some students also filed Github issue #64 about this.
This post has the solution: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017/discussion/forum/i4x-LinuxFoundationX-LFS171x-course-3T_2017/threads/5b472605c5264809bd00139c
I installed nvm using the instructions on the nvm github page README at https://github.com/creationix/nvm
Then I did ‘nvm install v8.9.0’, as recommended by the discussion post
Then I did ‘npm install’ again in the tuna-app directory, but got warnings about high risk vulnerabilities, so I ran the commands recommended in the warnings:
* npm I npm@latest -g
* npm install 
* npm audit fix
* did ‘npm install’ again & just low risk vulnerabilities remaining.  Was able to continue with the exercise from here.
I propose to add to add another Troubleshooting section with the suggestion that you might need v8.9.0 and give the pointer to the nvm repo to install nvm, 'nvm install v8.9.0' and repeat 'npm install'",open,False,2018-10-04 19:32:30,2018-10-08 01:35:35

Point 2: Remove video on DLT vs. Blockchain
=============================================
Remove the video, which confused students.  See Discussion forum post:
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017/discussion/forum/i4x-LinuxFoundationX-LFS171x-course-3T_2017/threads/5a78c95684452a081800089c.

Extend explanation that Blockchain is just a type of DLT by mentioning 2
other types of DLTs.

Point 3, Modified Point 4, Add missing link
================================================
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued)

3. Definition of block shouldn’t be split up with mention of bitcoin
concepts in between. I put the bitcoin example after block is
explained, for better concept flow.

4. Nonce relates to the Bitcoin example, so indicate that this list of 4
pieces of metadata refer to the Bitcoin example (which continues with
the Merkle Tree section in the next slide).

Bonus: ""or a brief history of blockchain technology, please click here.""
was missing the link ""here"". Added it.

Point 5: Remove conceptual speed bump
======================================

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued): I propose
to mention that Merkle tree root will be defined on the next page, to
remove a brain speed bump for students who don't know what a Merkle tree
is.

Here are my suggestions for improving Chapter 1.  If anyone feels strongly about any of them, please let me know in the next few days.  I plan to work on the markdown on Monday Sept 17, afternoon PDT.

1) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains: “A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for ""smart contracts"" and other assistive technologies.” but then Bitcoin is the next example & Bitcoin doesn’t natively enable smart contracts.  I propose to change this to “A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus.” and define Smart Contracts later on, when you are talking about blockchains that do enable smart contracts.

2) Video: The Difference between DLT and Blockchains (Brian Behlendorf): I propose to remove this video because it illustrates that the difference is muddy, instead of giving a new student a clear difference.  I think we don't want to confuse students so early in the course.  I saw a [thread about the confusion on the Discussion forum](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017/discussion/forum/i4x-LinuxFoundationX-LFS171x-course-3T_2017/threads/5a78c95684452a081800089c).  A better way to explain it is that a blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.  There are other types of DLT, like a hashgraph & tangle.  This can be described in text.  

3) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued): Definition of block shouldn’t be split up with mention of bitcoin concepts in between.  I propose to put the bitcoin example after block is explained, for better concept flow.

4) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued): ""A block commonly consists of four pieces of metadata: ... The proof of work, also known as a nonce"": I would leave out POW, since many blockchains don't use POW consensus & just give 3 pieces of metadata.  

5) Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) > Blockchains (Continued): I propose to mention that Merkle tree root will be defined on the next page, to remove a brain speed bump for students who don't know what a Merkle tree is. -> ""The Merkle tree root for the transactions included in this block. (Next slide will explain Merkle trees)""",open,False,2018-09-14 23:00:35,2018-09-18 08:09:56

after following the lesson, I realized I wasn't so confident I could understand the application so I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone. Learn go, and ensure I understood what was happening with the Sawtooth example.  And now that I have the example working, I believed it could be nice for people allergic to NodeJS to have a counterpart in a different language.

As of yet the features are working, if you have any recommendations to make the code cleaner, I'll be happy to implement them.

By the way, I had to commit the sawtooth_sdk as right now there is no `go get` that will easily retrieve the sdk (as opposed to fabric for instance)  because some libraries needed by the sdk are not present and must be generated by cloning their repo (cf [JIRA-STL-238](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-238)) 

Basically the equivalent of `processor/index.js` is `src/processor/main.go`  and `processor/handler.js` is `src/handler/handler.go`. The rest is the sawtooth_sdk compiled
