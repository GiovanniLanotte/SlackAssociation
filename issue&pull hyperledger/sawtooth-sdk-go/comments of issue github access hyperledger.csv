Go implementation of intkey client is available in examples/intkey_go/src/sawtooth_intkey_client

@Kaixinguoer210 that'll be a client application in go language.

There were many requests for writing a client application using sawtooth go sdk, I am working on merging this code. For time being you may find working code for intkey-go in my repository https://github.com/arsulegai/sawtooth-sdk-go/tree/intkey_go_client/examples/intkey_go/src/sawtooth_intkey_client also there's a PR raised on sawtooth-core repository for documenting how to build a client in go.",2018-10-26 11:41:45,2019-02-13 13:37:08

You should modify the line 135 in the processor/worker.go too. You can see my commit on sawtooth-core (https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/commit/56ab89faea2082a1820e22e89c8a18e9f3418b46) which is now obsolete since the go-sdk was removed in the core.

I have not been able to build it on Windows for the moment, but using [this](https://gist.github.com/danielcooperxyz/bda847cc6e663355baae00a41e7ae1e8) Dockerfile I can get and compile the sdk.
