I'm not seeing any changes. When I do a diff on crypto-lib and ursa I don't see any difference in API.
The implementations slightly changed due to a newer version of secp256k1 from 0.10 to 0.12 and amcl. The tests remain the same. Its still API compatible.",2018-12-19 15:46:42,2018-12-19 15:46:42

Yes so this would be the starting point for ursa then take existing crypt-lib and lay it on top of it. 
crypto-lib started just like this then I began to modify it to have crypto-lib looks today. So this is the first PR. The next one would take crypto-lib as is and merge it with this. The third one would take z-mix and merge it.",2018-12-03 17:53:39,2018-12-03 20:16:38
