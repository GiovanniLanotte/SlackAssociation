### Description of the Change

Synchronizer now is able to download missing blocks even when reject is happened in consensus.

### Benefits

Performance of the network can be increased in some cases.

**Explanation**
Some peers at the network can be out of sync (the peer is in round 3, when the rest in 5).
Such a peer previously could sync even when a commit of 6th block happened.
Now the peer can sync early and be in a synchronized state when a commit of the 6th block is happening. 
Thus there is a chance to do consensus step faster.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Still some changes has to be introduced by #2066 to the structure of `SynchronizationEvent`.

### Usage Examples or Tests

Create a `synchronize` subject in consensus to queue the events from the network without locking the operation of consensus
- Patch rxcpp to remove data race and allow using `current_thread` scheduler with `synchronize`
- Add subscriptions for subjects in irohad to manage their lifetime
- Add round parameter to Yac to close rounds that are less than or equal to current round
- Add `publish().ref_count()` to YacGateImpl observable to eliminate redundant calls to `flat_map` if multiple subscribers are present
- Fix data race in `getSpdlogLogLevel`
- Fix nondeterminism in `consensus_sunny_day` test 🎉 
- Allow usage of `blocking_observable` in TestSubscriber 

### Benefits
Consensus can process messages from the network while the pipeline is running

### Possible Drawbacks 
A separate thread is allocated to the pipeline

### Description of the Change

The priority queue `index_` in `MstState` is expected to be sorted in the order of batches expiration, but that does not hold in general case when the queue gets sorted by the first transaction timestamp. This change sorts the queue by the oldest transaction timestamp to fix the issue.

#### UPDATE ####

- `internal_state_` and `index_` were both used to store the batches, which complicated the logic and lead to a missing cleanup operation. Now there is only one storage - `batches_`.
- `MstState::operator==(const MstState &rhs)` previously checked whether `this->internal_state_` is a subset of `rhs.internal_state_`. Implementing it like a honest equality would be ineffective with batches stored in an unordered set. As this operator is used only once in a single test, I decided better to remove it than to keep an ineffective implementation.

The index type was changed to

### Description of the Change
The PR introduce changes for resending votes. The feature is required due to we want to simulate the asynchronous environment among YAC processors.

* Fix voting interface of consensus: now it requires value types for propagation.
* Add new interface for proto transport level with has feedback about the status of sending
* Add wrapper which can resend votes if it is required

### Possible Drawbacks 
* Lack of new proto transport test with different statuses.
* Probably there are missing two things: the decline of existed calls and attempt limitation.

### Description of the Change

This is a quite dirty fix of the issue discovered in failing `command_service_replay_test`. The problem is that calling `unsubscribe()` on a subscription from `rxcpp::subjects::synchronize<T, rxcpp::observe_on_one_worker>` does not block until a currently running subscribed observer finishes. This lead to `CommandServiceImpl` destruction while there was still running an observer on statuses that was using  `CommandServiceImpl::cache_` member, which got invalidated.

There is a task to find a better way to handle this type of problems: [IR-426](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR-426).

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/2191,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2191,lebdron,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0 Release Candidate 5,"HL Iroha team is happy to present the new Release Candidate. 
Here are some changes that we implemented in this release: 

## Pluggable Consensus: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2125

iroha::consensus::yac::SupermajorityChecker interface now has two implementations: a BFT and a CFT checker. Besides that all the signature-related logic was put away from that interface, and it now operates solely on numbers.
Set to BFT by default. 

## New logger! https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2126
Read more here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/configuration.html#logging

## Markdown to RST docs configuration: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2146 
Now Markdown files from the repository can be referenced in the ReadTheDocs documentation! 
We also improved build documentation: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2162

## Updated ed25519 cryptography to 2.0.1: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2157

## YAC storage cleanup: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1947
Old rounds are now cleaned up and that improves stability
StorageImpl: faster cleanup: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2174

## Added installation security tips to documentation
So you could make sure you use Iroha securely: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2129

## Updated configuration template for docker deployment: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2158 
and added documentation for new parameters: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2173

## Storage now only notifies subscribers of newly committed blocks after they have been actually applied to the ledger: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2179
Before, notification could be sent prior to actual commit which is not considered as correct behaviour. 

## Synchroniser subscription update: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2160 
Now if the synchroniser is waiting for the block for too long, it will break the connection. Also, if the block is failed to be checked, further blocks will not be received from that peer. 

### Debug deb packages support: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2144

### Decrease quantity of allocated proto query objects: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2148
Another improvement reducing memory consumption

### Now Iroha version is available through --version argument and in log pattern: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2127

### Added different Cmake sanitizers: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2131

### Added a fix for direct propagation in YAC. If a peer sends a vote for the old round, Iroha will share last finalized state: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2139

### Refactored ordering service queues: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2150

### Got rid of consensus race by changing round queue management: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2151
### Fixed race bug in command service: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2167

### Made YAC accept votes only from peers that it knows: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2134

### Created block storage dependency for mutable storage: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1994

### Added fix for status stream initialization: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2169
If runtime cache doesn't contain any value we are going to check the persistent cache for the value.

### Fixed hash set usage in OS. Fixed block leaks in YacGate and Simulator: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2170

### Made most block manipulation functions of storage take constant blocks by shared pointer: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2178

### Added implementation of `BlockStorage` interface based on `FlatFile`: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2180",[],42,2019-03-21 10:44:02,2019-03-21 12:42:13,2019-03-21 12:42:14,True,2019-03-21 12:42:13,neewy,unknown,,closed

### Description of the Change

This change brings the keys in tests to a consistent padding scheme, which is necessary because keys generated in various ways can finally be compared somewhere. And when a public key occasionally gets checked by field validator, it must have a fixed length, so it is better to choose a padding scheme which makes keys of the required length.

Some time ago, I wanted to get the latest data about project coverage and was confused with the results. As stated in https://github.com/JeremyAgost/lcov-llvm-function-mishit-filter repo: ""The lcov test coverage utility is designed to work with gcc and has some issued with running on binaries generated by the llvm compiler. One of these issues is that function signatures are output as lines that should be hit. However, while the binary is running those function signature lines are never registered as hit. Here's a simple python script to filter those lines from the lcov output.""

What I did is that I added a script that would remove partial hits from function signatures. Python script won't get updated a lot, I believe; however, we should monitor lcov issue for some time here: https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/issues/30

### Benefits

Honest coverage results 

### Possible Drawbacks 

Possibly manual maintenance of the script is required.

There are also some new features added.
Here are new improvements that are being released with RC 4!

### Fixes and updates reducing memory consumption and improving performance:
Fixed nested object copy in shared_model proto backend: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2096
Prevented CommandValidatorVisitor objects from copying: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2107
`Unsubscribe` fix: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2121
Reworked proposal sharing: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2085
Fixed busy waiting in transaction status stream loop: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2104
Removed block memory leak: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2103
Fixed command service infinite replay: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2102
YAC storage cleanup: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1947

### Test improvements:
Added performance test based on locust.io
Now Iroha’s performance can be tested. Read more here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2087
Test for new RX operator combine_latest_until_first_completed: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2122

### Documentation improvements:
Added important details about AddPeer command (public key validation): https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2098
Updated Iroha README: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2114


### Among other important updates: 
We finally removed SWIG dependency from the project: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2113
Added two more Ordering Gate configuration parameters: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2094
Added test@test keypair into samples close to the example genesis block: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2128
Fixed Ansible deployment scripts: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2099

### Known issues
Synchronization in networks, where more than f peers might shutdown, will fail after a node restarts since https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1947 PR was merged. This happens because synchronization between rounds relies on commit synchronization event. The issue will be fixed in further RC with the propagation of the last commit for the unsynchronized node.

Add different sanitizers flags into cmake.

### Benefits
- Convenient way to sanitize Iroha
- Different sanitizers can be turned on simultaneously
- Dependencies are also under sanitizer checks
- Make sanitizing in CI possible

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
- Have no idea about how does it work in Windows
- Standard library still remains uninstrumented
- Incompatible sanitizing options can be used
- Ubsan doesn't work with clang on Linux (linking issue, probably could be solved)

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests 
Four new cmake flags were introduced: _SANITIZE_THREAD_, _SANITIZE_ADDRESS_, _SANITIZE_MEMORY_, and _SANITIZE_UNDEFINED._ To use run:
`cmake -DSANITIZE_ADDRESS=ON ..`
Different flags can be set simultaneously but if they are incompatible you will get a build error.
For better results I would recommend to remove all dependencies from the system and let Iroha's cmake pull them - that way they will be also sanitized.
For better results standard library should be sanitized as well.
Leak detection is on by default on Linux when address sanitizer is on. For Mac you should use next command:
```
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 bin/irohad ...
```

### Description of the Change

In spdlog one cannot create two loggers with the same tag. But in the logger manager, loggers are created with lock-free compare-exchange method, which implies multiple logger instances creation. This fix makes them reuse the `spdlog::logger` objects with the `spdlog::get` library thread-safe function.

Also, an initialization race fixed for `logger::kDefaultLogPatterns` and rapidjson lib to iroha_conf_loader.

### Description of the Change

Here is a set of changes (each in a separate commit):
- moved log levels translation to a separate function which initializes a static map as soon as it is needed (fixes static initialization races)
- fixed formatting due to libfmt upgrade (seems that any `{..}` means a formatted argument now)
- added `tryGetValByKey` specialization for optionals to config file parser. Now optional config members can be made seamlessly
- made the logger configuration section of the config file optional (to avoid an unwanted breaking change)

### Description of the Change

For undefined reason block sent to ordering service notifier is not destroyed.
To fix that chain invocation of start_with and subscribe was split into two calls. That way it destroys the block
### Benefits

Less memory leaks

### Possible Drawbacks 

Reason of what block was not destroyed before is not defined",[],2,2019-02-15 08:36:34,2019-02-27 06:57:42,2019-02-27 06:57:45,True,2019-02-27 06:57:42,lebdron,unknown,,closed

### Description of the Change

Persistent cache for some reason was not integrated into command service.
That was resulting in infinite resending of a replayed transaction between Iroha components.

The fix makes CommandServiceImpl aware of persistent cache and the infinite loop is broken now.

Caches lookup strategy during batch processing in command service (even single incoming transaction will be represented as a batch internally):
* check command service tx status cache
* check persistent storage cache for replays

### Benefits

Potentially improved CPU and memory consumption.
Reduced network load.
An infinite resending of a replayed transaction between Iroha components is avoided.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Weird cache dependency for CommandServiceImpl appeared.

### Usage Examples or Tests

```
command_service_replay_test
```

compile and run irohad

#### Check that there is no infinite resending
run repro script https://gist.github.com/igor-egorov/ff56db9ca1de50215d6830f5980155d6

Iroha output should not contain inifinitely repeated message about duplicated transaction from `OnDemandOrderingServiceImpl` like ""Duplicate transaction: ...""

#### Check that correct statuses are delivered in tx status stream

repro script https://gist.github.com/igor-egorov/152b821faa335193569dec2246e578fb

You have to compile two versions of irohad: one from `develop` branch, another - from that pr.

Run the script with both irohad's and capture the output to files.
The statuses (their order) should not differ.",[],12,2019-02-14 17:27:50,2019-02-28 13:44:44,2019-02-28 13:44:50,True,2019-02-28 13:44:44,igor-egorov,unknown,,closed

### Description of the Change

The change contains modified copies of run_loop_state and run_loop objects from rxcpp.

The method `dispatch` of `run_loop` would not immediately return with the applied patch.
The method will pause execution on an additional cond var till some task will be scheduled for execution.

That fix solves the problem of busy waiting when we call dispatch inside a loop.

### Benefits

Decreased CPU usage

### Usage Examples or Tests

Locust #2087 settings are 1/1

### Description of the Change

`iroha::consensus::yac::SupermajorityChecker` interface now has two implementations: a BFT and a CFT checker. Besides that all the signature-related logic was put away from that interface, and it now operates solely on numbers.

Transaction status streaming fixed: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2033

Fix saving rejected tx hashes for failed atomic batches: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2043
When an atomic batch arrived with one stateful valid and one stateful invalid transaction, only one tx hash was saved to block as rejected (stateful invalid).
The second tx (stateful valid) was not saved as rejected too.

Fixed proposal validation and prevented resending of incomplete batches: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2044

Fixed segfault in StatusStream: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2053

Clients that expect immediate stream end after a final tx status receiving would not suffer from redundant delay now: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2073

Fixed memory leaks in Irohad: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2082, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2086

Fixed locking in OnDemandOrderingGate. Iroha does not become unresponsive after some period of time with constant load: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2088

Rejected status is emitted for rejected transactions in transaction processor: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2083

### Important! Configurable MST expiration time: 
This is a great tool for multisig, but it is important to update your config for new Iroha version (if you are ok with default 24 hours, please enter 1440):
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2046

### Selective block streaming
Previously, clients had one way to retrieve a stream of blocks: `FetchCommits` RPC call, which starts emitting blocks from the next committed one.
This PR introduces a new method to retrieve only one block using its height as an identifier: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2031

A quite dirty fix of deadlock occurring when one thread holding a `soci` connection calls some method of `StorageImpl` that needs to acquire a lock, and another thread calling `StorageImpl::dropStorage()` that acquires that lock exclusively first, and then waits for the connections to free.

### Benefits

Quick fix.

### Description of the Change

In some cases, the transaction status stream may not end in 10 seconds even if a final status (e.g. ""committed"") was already reported.


#### Details

That might happen when there are no transactions committed in the network and the delay between consensus rounds was increased up to 5 seconds.
The status stream gets forced to end in the case when tx status is not updated during two consensus rounds.

### Benefits

Clients that expect immediate stream end after a final tx status receiving would not suffer from redundant delay.

### Possible Drawbacks 

The solution is not elegant enough, because we do a kind of synchronization on a local variable. 
There is no data race because we do the processing in the same thread.

### Usage Examples or Tests

The gist is a repro script - https://gist.github.com/igor-egorov/e07d803b3ef9f17eee48804713140c04

In normal mode, the script will end less than in 20 seconds.

In degraded mode, the script would not finish even in a minute.

### Alternate Designs

Probably, `take_until(status_bus.last())` can be applied somehow.
That approach will avoid the usage of custom synchronization variables.
Unfortunately, take_until prevents the execution of subscribed lambdas when the source stream has ended by the moment of intended processing.",[],3,2019-02-01 16:46:51,2019-02-04 12:21:00,2019-02-04 12:21:07,True,2019-02-04 12:21:00,igor-egorov,unknown,,closed

During the review of the fake peers trunk, there arose an issue regarding using aliases. Together with @lebdron, @muratovv and @luckychess we came to a consensus of not hiding top-level type modifiers like `const`, `&`, `*` and smart pointers behind aliases, and also not to alias a type with no templates. The only exception is using an alias as a business logic type.

### Benefits

Standardized approach to using aliases.

### Possible Drawbacks 

As for me, the code has got less readable due to a lot of long and nested types being exposed distract from the higher-level picture.

Resolve `CryptoModelSigner` template usage issue: template explicit specialization in `crypto_model_signer_mock.hpp` caused ODR violation, since template was first instantiated in `simulator.cpp`, and later in `simulator_test.cpp` with a different implementation. 
Examples of errors:

### Description of the Change


Fix tx status streaming (#2033)

1. Consensus events now are delivered to all subscribers (TransportCommandService and Synchronizer)
2. Fixed non-graceful shutdown of tx status stream.

The first issue may lead to hang of client application in case when no events were emitted in the network.


Fix saving rejected txs hashes for failed atomic batches (#2043)

When an atomic batch arrived with one stateful valid and one stateful invalid transaction, only one tx's hash was saved to block as rejected (stateful invalid).
The second tx (stateful valid) was not saved as rejected too.


Fix proposal validation and prevent resending of incomplete batches (#2044)

Create standalone batch validator.
Add and integrate proto proposal validator.
Prevent resend/reprocessing of ""partially valid"" atomic batches
(some transaction has failed stateful validation 
within an atomic batch).
Add test.


Fix segfault in StatusStream (#2053)

Because of the misunderstanding of gRPC API, it was assumed that method Write(..) was thread-safe, but it isn't, and it caused a segfault when several threads called it at once. But, several threads should also not be in one lambda of the rxcpp observable, which is also a bug in our code. This is going to be fixed later, so now a mutex was added to ensure Write(..) is called only from one thread at the time.

Another thing fixed in this PR is that unsuccessful Write(..) was not taken into account, and the code tried to call it even after failure (for example, channel to client did not exist anymore), which is the reason for another potential segfault. This was fixed by checking Write(..)'s result.

### Benefits

Fix of the critical bug.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Code becomes slower because of the mutex - it must be removed after the mentioned issue is fixed.",[],6,2019-01-23 16:44:13,2019-01-24 15:36:48,2019-01-24 15:36:54,True,2019-01-24 15:36:48,Akvinikym,dirty,False,closed

Forward declaration headers for the new logger.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

The new logger related objects will be used through pointers. So the code that does not dereference those pointers can omit the inclusion of full headers. The major reason why we want it is the `fmt` header-only library used in the `logger.hpp` header, which one can keep away by using the `logger_fwd.hpp` header.

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

The logger-related includes appear in both headers (`logger_fwd.hpp`) and cpp-files (`logger.hpp`) - more includes overall.

This makes ITF Fake Peers apt for testing basic internal network communication between Iroha peers. Fake Peers get all needed network stubs and handles to simulate network environment in ITF tests.

### Description of the Change

This PR changes simulator functions processProposal and processVerifiedProposal, so that they return resulting objects, instead of broadcasting events. Event broadcasting still happens, but in a subscription lambda. This means that we can now access all field of incoming events when forming new event.

This is useful, if, for example we want to pass some information from one event to the other. This will be useful in the upcoming changes which store peer's list as some sort of ""Ledger state"" in all events.

### Description of the Change

For reasons unknown address sanitizer reported use after free on iroha shutdown, with MST enabled.
The problem was with unsubscribing from observable of GossipPropagationStrategy, which occured in FairMstProcessor destructor. I was not able to replicate this issue, or determine why it occured. 

My suspicion is that it is a false-positive from a address sanitizer. Changing initialization of observable seem to resolve this issue.

How to verify that it works:
1. Build irohad with address sanitizer
2. Set mst_enable to true in config
3. Run irohad
4. Shutdown irohad (Ctrl-C), address sanitizer should not report any issues.

Before this change `libintegration_framework` was linked to `libacceptance_fixture`, despite of it being not necessary. In this change they are decoupled, so that the executables may use `libacceptance_fixture` without `libintegration_framework`. Many tests relied on this implicit linkage, which is made explicit here.

### Benefits

Please make sure to check them out:

# Hex format for client API
Now all keys and hashes, and basically all API messages will use HEX format. It will be consistent from now and will make Iroha faster and more stable.
That is a breaking change, so please make sure your Iroha is compliant: #1998

# MST pending storage fixed
Previously, if batch was pending, and the same batch with all signatures comes, it went straight to the PCS. Because of that, the pending one was not removed and in theory could be replayed. Now, the system checks, if the arrived batch does already exist in MST storage, even if it has all signatures: #1959

# You can now run irohad natively on windows!
There are no tests at the moment though: #1988

# Memory leaks on iroha shutdown - fixed
Fixes couple of memory leaks on irohad shutdown by calling unsubscribe() in destructors: #1968

# Fixed subscription to transaction status updates
In Iroha you subscribe to receive status updates of the transaction. Previously, that was based on time factor - the status stream was breaking off after some time.
New round-based approach is fixing this issue - it will break off if there are no updates on the transaction in some rounds: #1980
Also fixed the case in which many transactions updates could crash clients: #1991 

# New style licence comments are here
Simply check out how neat looking they are :) Now it is easier to contribute new files: #1944 

# Lots of improvements in fuzzing tests
Removed OrderingGate (internal) fuzzing: #1981 
Updated RequestProposal endpoint fuzzing: #1983 
Updated query Find fuzzing target: #1982 
Fixed send_batches_fuzz and mst_fuzz: #1984 
Fixed fuzzing status: #1979 
Updated Torii fuzzing: #1951 

# Improved and made delay functionality pluggable to ordering gate init
             
Iroha will not wait more than 5 seconds between rounds in case of too many successive rejects: #1997 

# Improved create account command validation
Transaction creator should have all the permissions of default role of a domain where new account will be created: #1966 

# Improved synchronisation outcome logging
=^._.^= #1965 

# New compiler for tests and builds
Added libc++ to docker build image: #1970
 
# Some documentation improvements
Checked and fixed commands and queries documentation: #1971, #1938 
Fixed deployment instructions: #1972

### Description of the Change
Enable build with MSVC
- Add MSVC-specific conditionals to CMake - compiler flags, gRPC, dependencies - library names, link libraries
- Add Windows-specific config and genesis block examples
- Add missing `ciso646` and `cctype` includes
- Use `*soci::factory_postgresql()` instead of `soci::postgresql` - https://github.com/SOCI/soci/blob/3a1f602b3021b925d38828e3ff95f9e7f8887ff7/docs/connections.md#portability-note
- Explicitly specify return type in `iroha::ametsuchi::flatMapValue`, hopefully it will be removed soon
- Add missing try-catch for `soci::session::open` call
- Fix wrong noexcept specifier in explicit template instantiations
- Add missing `using namespace` directives

```

This warning actually is an error — as the docs cannot be built in target language. This had to be merged, otherwise people cannot see localized_docs.

I stumbled upon a race condition when the ITF was run and started sending out votes but the Fake Peers were not yet assigned a proper behaviour to react to them. Overcoming that seems impossible without separating genesis block generation from ITF starting to different external interface functions. While doing that I could also rework the interface of Fake Peers addition to the ITF without `future`s, because we now can initialize ITF main peer's key without starting ITF and assigning the genesis block.

### Benefits

Easier and more granular Fake Peer initialization.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Two ITF functions got exposed. One of them `initPipeline` may be not very clear for the users that do not know the guts of the ITF, but I kept it as is, because some existing code relies on it.  

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Please see `fake_peer_example_test`.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Providing an optional behaviour when requesting a fake peer, keeping the ugly design with `future`s.

### Description of the Change

Validation of CreateAccount command will respect a set of permissions of transaction creator.
It would not be possible to create an account in a domain which default role contain some permissions that are missing in transaction creator's permissions set.

In short: transaction creator should have all the permissions of default role of a domain where new account will be created.

That is it! A commit committed especially to fix the license comments!
New style license comment in most `.cpp`, `.hpp` and `CMakeLists.txt` files.

### Benefits

Less boilerplate stuff, less change requests on reviews. Also you need to scroll less =).

### How it was done

```bash
git grep --name-only 'Licensed under the Apache License,' '*.[ch]pp' |\
  while FS='\n' read fff; do
    cat $fff |\
      awk 'BEGIN{skipped_comment = 0;
        print ""/**\n * Copyright Soramitsu Co., Ltd. All Rights Reserved.\n * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n */""}
        {if (skipped_comment) print $0}
        /*\// {skipped_comment = 1}' | sponge $fff
  done

git grep --name-only 'Licensed under the Apache License,' '*/CMakeLists.txt' |\
  while FS='\n' read fff; do
    cat $fff |\
      awk 'BEGIN{state = 0; print ""#\n# Copyright Soramitsu Co., Ltd. All Rights Reserved.\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n#""}
        /^#/ {if (state == 0) state = 1}
        /^$/ {if (state == 1) state = 2}
        {if (state == 2) print $0}'| sponge $fff
  done
```

**UPDATE:** added license to files missing it:
```bash
git ls-files '*CMakeLists.txt' |\
  xargs -l awk 'BEGIN{state=0} /Apache/ {exit} /^#/ {state=1} /^[^#]/ {if (state=1) {print FILENAME; exit}}' |\
    while FS='\n' read fff; do
      (
        echo '#\n# Copyright Soramitsu Co., Ltd. All Rights Reserved.\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n#\n';
        cat $fff
      ) | sponge $fff;
    done
```

I also searched for `[ch]pp` files with no license with the following 1liner and found none (but found a double-licensed file `libs/common/default_constructible_unary_fn.hpp`):
```bash
git ls-files '*[ch]pp' | xargs -l awk 'BEGIN{state=0} /Apache/ {exit} /^ *\/\// {state=1} (!/^ *\/\// && state==1) || /\*\// {print FILENAME; exit}'

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1941,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1941,kamilsa,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0 Release Candidate 1,"We are happy to introduce the first release candidate for Hyperledger Iroha!
There were several major features implemented for the first production version of Iroha:

# Multi-signature Transaction (MST) is ready for use!

Now you can request several signatures to verify the transaction. And transactions can receive 2 more statuses: MST_PENDING for transactions waiting for more signatures and ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED for transactions that have already received the number of signatures requested ( #1649).

We have made MST possible with the following changes: 
- adding Storage for Pending Transactions: #1598 
- fixed sending batches to the Storage and retrieving them:  #1661 
- fixed retrieval of pending MST transactions: #1661 
- MST, reworked with batches: #1642 and client tests for MST: #1652  and other improvements.

Here is the example of MST use case: Alice and Bob are performing exchange between bitcoin and dogecoin using MST to perform exchange only when both participants agreed on the transfer #1761

**Important note:** MST is functional. However, there is a known issue: when user sends a completed MST transaction it's version without all signatures is not removed from MST storage, so when one asks for his pending transactions he will still see it. As a temporary workaround, you can remove all signatures after getting pending transactions and then sign them with your signature and send to Iroha.

# New fully BFT On-Demand Ordering Service is here!
Impressive preparations were made for the assembly of fully BFT (Byzantine-fault tolerant) Ordering service:

- BFT OS algorithm and interfaces: #1670
- on-demand ordering gate: #1675
- the transport: #1635 and on-demand connection manager: #1645
- the synchroniser: #1647
- BFT OS components: #1703
- Consensus Round as Key in YacStorages: #1729
- BFT YacGate: #1731
- BFT YaC: #1831 

And, finally, we merged the new BFT Ordering Service: #1923

# API changes:
There were some serious API changes, so please make sure that your code is compatible with:
- Iroha versions in the block: #1893
- GetAccountTransactions query pagination: #1903
- Renamed client services: #1881
- Storing rejected transactions' hashes in the block: #1815 

# Replaced builders with factories
Now the code runs faster with changed design of its components. Here are our new factories within the code:

- factory for a block: #1622
- factory for transaction status creation: #1717
- factory for query responses and tests: #1724
- abstract factory for creating batches from transactions: #1743
- transport factory: #1750

# Error Responses
Real error reasons for real people using Iroha - introducing Query Error Responses so you could know why the query failed: #1770
Stateful Error Codes in Postgres Command Executor, Endpoint and to SFV: #1813, #1817, #1821
Stateful Response Error Codes: #1837


# Replay prevention:
In different Iroha components: #1857, #1868, #1865, #1868
Feature of storing rejected transactions' hashes in blockchain: #1815
Rejected txs index: #1846

# Preparations for backward compatibility:
Added Iroha version into the block: #1893. Then we updated proto block validator for the new structure of the block: #1905.

# And some of the smaller though very important ones…
## Optimised command and query SQL
A complex work was done to optimise the work of SQL for both commands and queries: #1605
## Consensus Cache in Block Loader and YAC Gate
We constantly move towards faster Iroha. 
Now there is no need for a node to wait time to ask another node for synchronisation thanks to the consensus cache. So let us say good-bye to load_delay: #1627
## SWIG-free Iroha library for Python
Platform independent. Lighter. Better solution if you want to use Python with Iroha: #1761
## SubtractAssetQuantity command
Was not previously implemented in Iroha-cli but now works correctly with AddAssetQuantity: #1713
## Domain asset permissions
Now it is possible to restrict ability to add or subtract assets within domain: #1924 
## Benchmarks to measure performance
We are introducing a benchmark that executes GetAccount query and a benchmark that executes AddAssetQuantity command to have more information on the performance: #1651  and #1648
## Empty Roles
The purpose of append role command is to promote an account to some created role in the system, where a role is a set of permissions account has to perform an action (command or query). It was impossible to add a role without permissions to account. Now it is possible: #1654
## reducedHash
reducedHash wrapper is now visible to libraries and can be called by clients: #1659
## TransactionBatchParser
Splits a list of transactions by possible adjacent batches: #1750
## Genesis Parser
It will generate a nice md file with tables of accounts, permissions and other parameters of the genesis block: #1775
## Query pagination: 
Now you can get transaction query results using pagination: #1903, #1927 
Introduce queries pagination by @nickaleks · Pull Request #1927 ·...

## Improved tests
Here are some of the most influential results:

- the ability to send transaction sequences to the ITF and check stateless valid/invalid status: #1660 ITF feature of checking all the specified statuses: #1720
- Fuzzing targets for ordering service endpoints, consensus, MST and for BlockLoader endpoints: #1829, #1839, #1845, #1840

## Fixes
Please also make sure to check out some important fixes and see if your Iroha is not affected by them:

- freeConnections method, which disposes all currently used connections was fixed: #1727
- send tx sequence method: #1685
- Consensus VoteOther case: #1834
- ITF bugs related to BFT OS: #1826
- tx-example.py and blocks-query.py: #1844
- verbosit flag is now working: #1942 

## DevOps news

- CMake version Minimum CMake version requirement is now 3.11.2 to use cool new features of it in Iroha: #1667
- Iroha on Kubernetes cluster 
- Now Iroha can be run on Kubernetes: #1697

### Description of the Change

Previously uncommitted transactions cache was removing by reduced hash of transaction batch. However block event emitted to ordering gate returns hashes of transactions. So the fix removes batches from the cache by transaction's hash. So, if any batch in transaction cache contains transaction with given transaction hash, then entire batch with that transaction is removed from the cache

No more duplication warnings

### Description of the Change

This PR introduces pagination logic to GetAccountAssetTransactions query.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->

### Benefits
Pagination for query
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

Since logic of getAccountTransactions and GetAccountAssetTransactions is almost the same, their logic was moved to a common function. This function might be confusing.

### Description of the Change
- Since it is not possible to create block query from storage after it has been dropped, each `getBlockQuery` call should be checked for `nullptr` after call.
- It is also possible to catch an exception when SQL query is executed. `PostgresBlockQuery::checkTxPresence` is refactored with try-catch for this reason.

It is possible to use `Result` instead of optional in `PostgresBlockQuery::checkTxPresence`, however is will be more difficult to handle it in calling methods.

### Description of the Change

Synchronyzer's algorithm is fixed.

Synchronizer was not able to sync when too many transactions were arriving.

The root cause is:
The synchronizer is triggered by some commit A.
The network was able to apply commit B on top of A.
The peer that requested missing blocks receives pre-A, A, B commits.
The peer checks that the hash of the last received block equals to A hash.
The check is failed -> sync is not done.

### Benefits

Fixed synchronizer.
The [issue](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR-46) cannot be reproduced.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Only existing tests are available.
The test that sets up four nodes and checks the case is missing.
Implementing of such test suite will cost too much by now.

### Description of the Change
Before it was:

```
message Block {
  // block_v1 fields
}
```

From now on it will be
```
message Block_v1 {
// block_v1 fields
}

message Block {
  oneof block_version {
    Block_v1 block_v1 = 1;
  }
}
```

Such changes would allow us to introduce Block_v2 and further versions, by simply adding them to oneof in Block message. Internally we will be able to recognize and manage different version of the blocks.

### Benefits

Currently k8s-iroha Ansible playbook uses a Python script to save each peer key pair to `files/conf`. The command `kubectl create configmap` should be called afterwards to save the: peer key pairs, genesis block and config to Kubernetes.

This PR will generate secrets in k8s-peer-keys.yaml alongside the statefulset in k8s-iroha.yaml. The statefulset will use a init container (busybox) to copy create peer keys for each pod. I see this as a temporary implementation, once PodPresets become available there wont be any need to copy the keys before the Iroha container starts.

Additionally persistent volumes will be requested for both the Postgres and Iroha block store volumes. `emptyDir` was used previously which would forget data between restarts. If this temporary store feature is required I can implement a config option to use `emptyDir` for storage in the statefulset.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

- Each Iroha peer gets it's own Kubernetes Secret, each pod can only read it's allocated Secret.
- Resulting Configmap is smaller as it doesn't need to store any key pair files.
- Persistent storage now configurable for both Postgres and Iroha's block store.

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

- Temporary storage for statefulset no longer used. As mentioned above I can add it if needed
- Slightly more complicated pod initialization
- Postgres starts in the same pod and might not be ready when irohad tries to connect (sleep was used previously, might use it again that if there isn't a better option)

### Description of the Change

This is a better implementation of #1776.

The problem is that CI needs to be able to launch `irohad` that will restore the existing state with the same set of flags as that was passed at the first launch.

The new way of launch parameters handling is implemented. All the possible cases is covered.

The new truth table is below:

For a better understanding of changes made in code please take a look at two execution flowcharts (old and new one).
#### Old execution flow
![old_flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36847043/48899420-9cd0c980-ee60-11e8-9e26-508e4b3bd6f1.png)
#### New execution flow

### Benefits

Nothing is changed in already exposed API.
No unexpected behavior is added.
All the combinations of three parameters (presence of blockstore, presence of new genesis_block, presence of overwrite_ledger flag) are covered.


### Possible Drawbacks 

None?

Meet integration_framework::PortGuard - a class that keeps track of ports you use in ITF tests! Just add an instance in your class where you allocate ports, and ask it for some in a given range. When your class dies (sorry), it will in its final moments mark the ports your instance requested as free.

### Benefits

It should make port reusing easier.

### Possible Drawbacks 

It uses locks for synchronization.",[],10,2018-11-14 07:35:42,2018-11-30 15:27:05,2018-12-09 16:48:23,True,2018-11-30 15:27:05,MBoldyrev,dirty,False,closed

Finally these awful test are started to be refactored. First on the list is torii_service_test. It was splitted to the CommandSyncClient part (with server) and CommandServiceTransportGrpc (with only mocks)

### Benefits

Cleaner test code for one more component

### Possible Drawbacks 

None

### Usage Examples or Tests

`torii_transport_command_test` and `command_sync_client_test` targets are affected

### Alternate Designs

There's an awful workaround with using `reinterpret_cast` for deriving from a final class (that basically an UB, but works meh). Fortunately it's only required for tests. Two alternatives that I can see right now is class interface extension and gRPC patching. Probably the first one is better, though quite tough to make it in the same pr. Here the block of nasty code

Finally it comes.
It seems that client_test doesn't really check behavior of CliClient as intended, but instead duplicate the integration tests that already present in unit test folder (😢). Since it's painful for the support we discussed with @muratovv that it should be removed from the project.

### Benefits

Lesser stuff to support

### Possible Drawbacks

No tests for CliClient, cli is even less maintained

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1832,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1832,neewy,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0 beta-5 version,"We are happy to introduce various improvements of Hyperledger Iroha for beta-5 release and tell you more about what we accomplished together.

There were several major features implemented or prepared:

## Multi-signature Transaction (MST)
Now you can request several signatures to verify the transaction. And transactions can receive 2 more statuses: MST_PENDING for transactions waiting for more signatures and ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED for transactions that have already received the number of signatures requested (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1649).

**Known issues**: 
1. Iroha can apply multi-signature transactions several times, due to lack of transaction replay protection.
2. When a user sends a completed MST transaction then it is not removed from MST storage, so when one asks for their pending transactions they will still see it. As a temporary workaround, you can remove all signatures after getting pending transactions and then sign them with your signature(s) and send to Iroha.

We have made MST possible with the following changes: 
    - adding Storage for Pending Transactions: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1598
    - fixed sending batches to the Storage and retrieving them:  https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1661
    - fixed retrieval of pending MST transactions: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1661
    - MST batches: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1642 and client tests for them: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1652
    and other improvements. 

Here is the example of MST use case: Alice and Bob are performing exchange between bitcoin and dogecoin using MST to perform exchange only when both participants agreed on the transfer https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1761

## New fully BFT On-Demand Ordering Service is almost ready (only needs some finishing touches)!
Impressive preparations were made for later assembly of fully BFT (Byzantine-fault tolerant) Ordering service. We already prepared:
 - BFT OS algorithm and interfaces: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1670
 - on-demand ordering gate: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1675
 - the transport: #1635  and on-demand connection manager: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1645
 - the synchronizer: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1647
 - BFT OS components: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1703
 - Consensus Round as Key in YacStorages: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1729
 - BFT YacGate: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1731

**Important note:** at the moment Iroha uses an old version of Ordering Service, which will be obsolete in the next release (later this month).

## Replaced builders with factories 
Now the code runs faster with the changed design of its components. 
Here are our new factories within the code:
 - factory for a block: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1622
 - factory for transaction status creation: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1717
 - factory for query responses and tests: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1724
 - abstract factory for creating batches from transactions: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1743
 - transport factory: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1750

## Query Error Responses
Real error reasons for real people using Iroha — introducing Query Error Responses so you could know why the query failed: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1770

## And some of the smaller though very important ones:

### Optimized SQL queries for Iroha commands and queries 
A complex work was done to optimize the work of SQL for both commands and queries: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1605

### Consensus Cache in Block Loader and YAC Gate
We constantly move towards faster Iroha. Now there is no need for a node to wait time to ask another node for synchronization thanks to the consensus cache. So let us say good-bye to load_delay: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1627

### SWIG-free Iroha library for Python
Platform independent. Lighter. A better solution if you want to use Python with Iroha: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1761

### SubtractAssetQuantity command
Was not previously implemented in Iroha-cli but now works correctly with AddAssetQuantity: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1713

### Benchmarks to measure performance 
We are introducing a benchmark that executes a GetAccount query and a benchmark that executes AddAssetQuantity command to have more information on the performance: #1651 and #1648 

### Empty Roles
The purpose of append role command is to promote an account to some created role in the system, where a role is a set of permissions account has to perform an action (command or query). It was impossible to add a role without permissions to account. Now it is possible: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1654

### reducedHash
a reducedHash wrapper is now visible to libraries and can be called by clients: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1659

### TransactionBatchParser
Splits a list of transactions by possible adjacent batches: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1750

### Genesis Parser 
It will generate a nice MD file with tables of accounts, permissions and other parameters of the genesis block: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1775


## Improved tests
Here are some of the most influential results:

- the ability to send transaction sequences to the ITF and check stateless valid/invalid status: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1660
ITF feature of checking all the specified statuses: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1720

## DevOps news
CMake version
Minimum CMake version requirement is now 3.11.2 to use cool new features of it in Iroha: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1667

Iroha on Kubernetes cluster
Now Iroha can be run on Kubernetes: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1697

 - freeConnections method, which disposes all currently used connections was fixed: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1727
 - send tx sequence method: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1685

One more possibility to find bugs and issues in the code.

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

This code has to be built with mainstream clang (not an apple's one) and currently fuzzing option is not turned on by default - it makes this code hard to support.

### Usage Examples or Tests

Set compiler paths to your local clang binaries.
```
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++  -DFUZZING=ON ..
make ordering_gate_fuzz
```

### Description of the Change

Adds caching of uncommitted transactions. Cache works as the queue of batches collections. Queue's size is always 3. It works as follows:

#### `OnDemandOrderingGate::propagateBatch(Batch B)` is invoked:

given the following state of the cache:

```
head
1. {a, b, c}
2. {d, e}
3. {f, g}
tail
```

1. The batches from the head of the queue are concatenated with the batch
`batches = {a, b, c, B}`
2. Batches are sent to network
3. The head of the queue is cleaned
```
1. {}
2. {d, e}
3. {f, g}
```
4. Batches are added to the tail of the queue
```
1. {}
2. {d, e}
3. {f, g, a, b, c, B}
```

#### `BlockEvent` containing batches {a,b} is received from OS:
given the following state of the cache:

```
head
1. {a, b, c}
2. {d, e}
3. {f, g}
tail
```

1. `up` is invoked, which shifts all BatchLists towards the head. Batches from the middle ({d, e} in example) are concatenated with head batches ({a,b,c}):
```
1. {a, b, c, d, e}
2. {f, g}
3. {}
```
2. All batches from the event ({a,b}) are removed from the top:
```
1. {c, d, e}
2. {f, g}
3. {}
```

### Benefits

The transactions that were not committed will be resent to the network

### Possible Drawbacks 

The logic of the caching can be too sophisticated, and probably can be somehow simplified
### Usage Examples or Tests

Tests for cache and for on demand ordering gate with cache added 

### Alternate Designs

Live without caching

### Description of the Change

Bug with 100%+ Iroha node overload was appearing because of block streaming service, which was based into RxCpp blocking observable. In version, used in current Iroha, it had a serious issue - spinlock - which was addressed here and fixed August 6 2018. So, this pull request updated a version of RxCpp up to the current one.

### Benefits

No more useless node overload.

### Possible Drawbacks 

With the current RxCpp version it seems that it is not sufficient to `#include <rxcpp/rx-observable.hpp>`, but a whole `#include <rxcpp/rx.hpp>`, which can theoretically lead to increased compilation time.

### Usage Examples or Tests

The use case can be tested manually through Python's scripts `blocks-query.py`, which is to launched first, and then `tx-example.py`. Because of subscription to blocks in the first script, the 100% load appeared before fixing the bug. Now, it isn't.

1. Reduce the number of database queries. Single query used to perform the required validation.
2. Reduce the number of data fetches. Since signatories are not required to be fetched from database, only a single fetch is done instead of number of signatures.

### Description of the Change

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

1. Use env variables instead of fixed parameter names (config.docker, genesis.block)
2. Autodetect `postgres host` and `blocks dir` based on config json (by cost of installing small `jq` utility in release Dockerfile).
3. Enable error mode (`-e`) and debug mode (`-x`), so that you don't need to `echo` all variables to get their values. Output will be something like 
    ```
    + GENESISBLOCK_PATH=genesis.block
    + CONFIG_PATH=config.docker
    + POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    ++ cat config.docker
    ++ jq -r .pg_opt
    ++ grep -Eo 'host=(.*?)\s'
    ++ cut -d= -f2
    ++ xargs
    ++ cat config.docker
    ++ jq -r .block_store_path
    + BLOCKS_PATH=/blocks
    + POSTGRES_HOST=iroha.postgres
    ```
4. Change `ENTRYPOINT` to `CMD`: idiomatically entrypoint works as a prerequisite script for CMD. Example:
    ```
    $ docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash -xe -c ubuntu ""echo 1""
    # is the same as
    $ docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash -xe -c ""echo 1""
    ```
    So, when blocking entrypoint is defined (as version before change), any commands `docker exec -it <container> bash` will be also blocked. This change fixes this behavior.
5. Add `wait-for-it.sh` inside container, so it will not fail if that script called.
6. Add grpc healthcheck

### Benefits

1-2. Flexible deployment
3. If error mode is enabled, then all scripts succeeded (expected behavior). If debug mode is enabled, then you can see what commands were executed, what what variables were passed to env vars.
4. Now you can do `docker run -it <container> bash`. Before change, it did not work.
5. Bugfix, which could let container fail.
6. Other tools that can check docker healthcheck can now check if iroha is started

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

You may forget to call `/run-iroha.sh` from the `/opt/iroha_data` dir and end up with bash errors because default variables contain paths in ""current dir"". By default `/run-iroha.sh` is called from the workdir, so this is not really a drawback.

Before this change ITF used direct calls to service. After this patch ITF uses the same code to issue transactions and requests, as the clients do.

### Benefits

Tests come one step closer to real use cases.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Testing may slow down due to additional resources usage (network stack).

### Description of the Change
Chain validator was not able to validate chains of more than 1 block because it did not apply the blocks, thus having incorrect peers list and previous hash in validation second and subsequent blocks.
Block apply method is used instead of check now, and check method is removed because it is unused.

Bug appears, when one of nodes goes down and then tries to synchronize itself with other ones, but at least one commit was accepted during its down state, and new consensus round started. Then, it tried to download block from the last round, but on other peers this block was already substituted by a new one in consensus cache, leading to result that BlockLoader did not give it, taking that node into an infinite loop.
Bug fix makes BlockLoader to look to the BlockStorage after the cache missed.

This bug went away.

### Description of the Change

1. This PR removes duplicity from ansible deployment playbooks.

4 roles are removed:
- `iroha-standalone-config-gen`
- `iroha-cluster-config-gen`
- `iroha-standalone-deploy-node`
- `iroha-cluster-deploy-node`

2 roles are introduced:
- `iroha-config-gen`
- `iroha-nodes`

2. The issues with iroha deployment are finally fixed:
- no more confusion in `config.sample` or `config.docker` files
- no more outdated configuration in `config.docker` files

3. Fixed dependencies - no more `iroha-cli` required.  `ed25519-cli` is now shipped with this ansible playbook. Everything works from scratch.

### Benefits

They are listed in the previous 

### Possible Drawbacks 
1. `ed25519-cli` adds significant size to the repo. Maybe as soon as Bogdan (@Warchant) released it, we could download it from github.
2. It possibly might fail on Mac OS as `ed25519-cli` is not compiled in Mach-O format.

### Description of the Change

Some queries have similar permission rules, and it seems rational to maintain a single set of tests to check the common cases.

In this commit, the common data and procedures are moved to `QueryPermissionTestBase` class, and the common Google test macros are parameterized with its derived specializations for every tested query.

### Benefits

Easier common tests maintenance.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Yet to find out.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

The common tests are built to query_permissions_common_test binary. The specific tests that have sense only for their target query are left where they were.

### Description of the Change

This is the first PR to develop uncommitted transactions caching in Iroha. To make caching work it is needed to know what transactions has been committed, thus all block should be emitted to ordering gate
### Benefits

Foundation for uncommitted transactions caching is introduced

### Possible Drawbacks 

None

### Description of the Change
Remove transaction sequence usage from irohad, introduce
- TransactionBatchParser, which splits a list of transactions by possible adjacent batches
- TransportFactory interface and protobuf implementation, which allows to mock the deserialization step in tests
One boost header was copied with slight change to allow moving non-copyable parameters in ranges:

Before:
```C++
    template<typename Arg>
    R operator()(const Arg& arg) const
    {
        BOOST_ASSERT(m_impl);
        return (*m_impl)(arg);
    }
    template<typename Arg>
    R operator()(Arg& arg) const
    {
        BOOST_ASSERT(m_impl);
        return (*m_impl)(arg);
    }
```
After:
```C++
      template <typename Arg>
      R operator()(Arg &&arg) const {
        BOOST_ASSERT(m_impl);
        return (*m_impl)(std::forward<Arg>(arg));
      }

### Description of the Change
- add wait-for-it.sh script
- modify entrypoint.sh to use wait-for-it.sh
- introduces new variables IROHA_POSTGRES_HOST and IROHA_POSTGRES_PORT
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
More reliable method to detect if Postgres is ready before running Iroha (which would fail otherwise)
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
IROHA_POSTGRES_HOST and IROHA_POSTGRES_PORT variables do not override ones defined in config file. In fact, we should manually check that they match. Otherwise, wait-for-it script just exits on timeout without an error. By that time Postgres most probably would be up and ready to accept connections.
But in case IROHA_POSTGRES_HOST is not defined, we just try to run `irohad` command straight off. This may fail as Postgres is not yet running.
As soon as https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1567 is implemented, variables passed for `wait-for-it.sh` will also override ones defined in config file. Doing this we avoid having vain timeouts and run Iroha as soon as Postgres is ready.

### Description of the Change
Introduces test reports for each build running on Jenkins CI
- Modify `ctest` command options to generate XML report
- Added Python script for parsing the report and tagging each test with a platform name. That is because XUnit is unable to differentiate between tests with the same names runnning on different platforms in a final report
- Use `xunit` Jenkins build step to generate a dashboard out of XML report

### Benefits

### Description of the Change
- Replace static Jenkins build agents with on-demand ones
- Disable code coverage for all branches but `master`. It consumes a significant amount of time during the build, while coverage metric is not as useful as planned initially.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
- Reduce infrastructure monthly bill by executing builds on AWS agents that are started up on-demand and shut down after a certain timeout if no builds are running on it
- Faster builds due to disabled coverage
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
- Slightly higher latency between ""Start build"" event sent to Jenkins and actual execution of the build as AWS agent requires some time for initialization. Although, not relevant in case an agent is already up and running
- `ccache` build cache is not available anymore as each agent starts up with a clean hard drive. However, this should not be a problem as the current utilization of the cache is pretty low already. That is because of many concurrent builds running on the same copy of the cache. The solution is to have a separate version of the cache for each PR/branch but that is not practically possible.

### Description of the Change
Templight report for YacGateImpl showed that boost::variant templates for command type were instantiated. However, command type is unused in YacGate, so they should not be instantiated in compile time. Changes in this pull request remove these instantiations, and reduce the compile time from 400s to 60s according to Templight reports.

Main changes:
- Forward declarations instead of includes for interface command:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/bcfb800ac296892624b9fb87f8b7ffcaf744199b/shared_model/interfaces/commands/command.hpp#L15-L30
- Extern templates:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/bcfb800ac296892624b9fb87f8b7ffcaf744199b/shared_model/interfaces/commands/command.hpp#L79-L97
- Separate transaction sequence factory from transaction sequence to remove protobuf and validator dependency from shared model interfaces
- Remove proto backend usage in stateful validator
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

Note:
Why are exactly the following instantiations needed?
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/bcfb800ac296892624b9fb87f8b7ffcaf744199b/shared_model/interfaces/commands/impl/command.cpp#L27-L34
It is because they were the only templates reported by the compiler as undefined references.

### Benefits

### Description of the Change
 - Restrict storage lifetime to callback in simulator and synchronizer. This prevents storage deadlocks, since resources are released before calling `on_next`, which in turn calls subscribers callbacks.
 - Refactor `operator|` bind calls and `match` calls to remove null pointers using `boost::get`.

### Description of the Change
This PR introduces support for deploying Iroha on Kubernetes cluster. PR consists of two major components that configure instances and run Iroha service:
- Terraform: prepares infrastructure for deploying Kubernetes cluster. It deploys user-configurable number of EC2 nodes in multiple AWS regions (3 by default) and creates VPC peering between them for seamless communication
- Ansbile: there are two related roles
  1. kubespray. External module that deploys production-grade k8s cluster
   2. iroha-k8s. A role for generating configuration files for N Iroha nodes

Pod specification file can also be used for manual deployment. Terraform modules are ready for manual deployment as well if one needs it.
For more info regarding the structure and internals see README file in iroha-k8s Ansible role
There is also Deployment manual that describes the steps required for deploying k8s cluster from scratch and running Iroha service on it.

### Description of the Change
Since timestamps of transactions are required to be validated against block or proposal timestamp, a separate method which has additional timestamp argument is required, because nested field validator is inaccessible.
Timestamp validation is removed from proposal and block because they require timestamp validation, which differs from transactions.

This PR removes duplication in methods `Torii` and `ListTorii` by wrapping transactions into batches and processing them in a uniform way. Thus, method `TransactionProcessor::transactionHandle` was no longer needed and now removed.
The second thing done in this PR was that batches did not allow creation without transaction validation - for test purposes - due to lack of custom validators support. So, definitions of template methods of `TransactionBatch` were transferred into special `.hpp` file, allowing clients to extend them with their own validators - example of such extension can be found in `batch_helper.hpp`.

### Benefits

No code duplication and steps to the bright extendable future.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Please, pay attention that now `CommandService::Torii` calls `DefaultSignedTransactionValidator` twice: to create proto transaction and to create transaction batch.

The idea behind the fix is emulating client behavior while getting tx statuses - resubscribing.

### Benefits

Passing tests in a various environments.
Test behavior now is a bit closer to the behavior of a real Iroha user.


### Possible Drawbacks 

None. 

### Usage Examples or Tests

```
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build --target torii_service_test
cd build
ctest -R torii_service_test --output-on-failure
```

### Description of the Change
Implementation of connection manager component for on demand OS. Manager receives new peers and forwards the requests. Methods are thread safe.
It uses connection factory each time new peers are received, so that required peers are used with each update.
Shared lock is used to allow concurrent method calls and updates of peers.

### Description of the Change

There were no links on permissions page to GetAccountDetail query. 

Also, we thought that the description of the query was missing too, but it was created some time ago. Thus, this pr adds only the links to the command description.

### Description of the Change

Since running a docker is not always required for local development, a postgresql instance could be enough for certain cases. First script `scripts/run-postgresql-dev.sh` starts the `postgresql` container. Second script `scripts/stop-postgresql-dev.sh` stops and removes the container and its dependencies such as volumes.

### Benefits

Script `run-pg-dev.sh` prints `<ip_address>`:`<port>` of the launched instance

### Possible Drawbacks 

If docker container with name `postgres`exists, please run `stop-pg-dev.sh` script first

In that case, block store was not empty and nobody did its cleanup, because of the exception.

### Usage Examples or Tests

regression_test

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs

Generally speaking, all the ITF tests need to be wrapped into test fixtures where the tearDown method will do block store cleanup for the cases when ITF throws an exception.

The suggested fix is a must-have fix for regression test because StateRecovery case does sequential initialization of two ITF instances. Any exception inside the first instance will prevent calling the destructor of the second instance and block store will be left dirty.

### Description of the Change

The test (StreamingFullPipelineTest) was failing on slow machines. 
Investigation showed that the root cause was the way thread scheduler works, so the code was generally valid.

Streaming client resubscription is a fully valid use case of streaming service.
The client can resubscribe to the stream if the previous stream was ended unexpectedly for the client.
Unexpectedly means that client requests the hash of a transaction that was definitely sent to Iroha and the stream reaches its end with one of the following statuses: `NOT_RECEIVED`, `STATELESS_VALIDATION_SUCCESS`, `STATEFUL_VALIDATION_SUCCESS`.

Before the fix test client was not able to resubscribe to the stream. Now it can.

### Benefits

Legal test client behavior is implemented.
The test is not failing.

### Possible Drawbacks 

None

### Usage Examples or Tests

### Description of the Change

Currently, AsyncGrpcClient is used via inheritance, to provide an ability to call grpc endpoints. This is hard to read and understand, so goal of this change is to replace inheritance with composition, and create one AsyncGrpcClient and use it in all components which use it.

AsyncClientCall creation and initialization moved to AsyncGrpcClient class and logic encapsulated in `call` method.

### Description of the Change
Fixes a rare case when Docker images are not pushed to Dockerhub. This happens when there is a PR for merging `develop` branch into `master` and changes are introduced into Dockerfile. The code in Jenkins file checks for branch name equals `develop` and pushes an image. This check fails when there is a PR opened as branch name in this case equals to something like `PR-****`. 
We now check for parent branch of a PR as well.

### Description of the Change

The storage listens to MST events and keeps track of semi signed transactions or batches of transactions. 
The storage is a backend for ""getPendingTransactions"" query. 
It returns all the transactions or batches of transactions created by query originator (single transactions or transactions from returned batches require more signatories to be processed).

### Benefits

Storage for pending transactions is implemented and covered by tests.

### Possible Drawbacks 

This PR cannot be compiled until corresponding changes will be made in MST.

### Usage Examples or Tests


```diff
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build --target pending_txs_storage_test
cd build
ctest -R pending_txs_storage_test --output-on-failure
```

### Alternate Designs

Storage is not divided to interface and implementation since having just the implementation is acceptable in that case.

Potentially, internal structures can be replaced with `tbb::concurrent_{vector,hash_map}`. We use two maps as underlying structures and concurrent tbb structures would not solve the problem of simultaneous lock of both maps.",[],10,2018-07-25 11:22:19,2018-08-28 10:42:49,2018-08-28 10:44:49,True,2018-08-28 10:42:49,igor-egorov,dirty,False,closed
iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1597,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1597,neewy,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0 beta-4 version,"In this release following changes were made:

## Faster throughput, pluggable state storage

There is less abstraction on state storage level, and validation is done with means of SQL queries. It has significantly improved the performance of Iroha peer and made it less error-prone (#1557). 

State storage is plugged over ORM library titled as SOCI, which bundles a nice thread pool for faster interconnection with PostgreSQL; and makes it possible to switch to other supported SQL storage (how about using in-memory SQLite database for even faster throughput? #1505)

## Stateful validation errors

All the stateful validation errors are printed in peer logs and response is sent to a client along with transaction status. Now it is a lot easier to check what went wrong with a rejected transaction (#1508)

**Important note:** this version of Iroha can disclose some personal data like account balance (if a transaction was statefully invalid —account can now get the reason). In the future version we will implement error codes ([check them there](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/439189508/POW+N+075+Stateful+response))

## Binary Testing Framework 

This is a test framework that helps testing client libraries (now particularly in Python) if they produce valid transactions and queries (if permissions and other business rules were met #1485)

## Transaction status streaming over RxCpp

[Reactive extensions library in C++](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp) is actively used in our architecture and now is in charge of transaction status processing (#1541)

## Input fuzzing

Libfuzz checks the input in our client component (called Torii) and protobuf messages are mutated as well (#1531) 

## Blocks and proposals are not copied now (and their creation process is benchmarked)

A proposal is a candidate for becoming the next block in Iroha chain. The lifetime of these objects is important, this is why their creation and copying has to be minimized by means of C++ (#1542, #1567)
Creation is benchmarked by means of Google Benchmark library (#1539)

## Check the size of signatures set 

One of the bugs, that was revealed with help of fuzzing, was a possibly valid empty signature set attached to a transaction. This behavior was fixed in #1536.

## API changes

### Transaction batch support 

Transaction batch is a set of transactions, which are to be applied together. There are two kinds of batches:
- Ordered batch
     - transactions will be applied strictly in the order they were received
- Atomic batch
    - the order is still guaranteed
    - failure of any transaction inside it leads to failure of the whole batch


**Important note:** this feature was not implemented completely in this release, however, interfaces and SDKs have already been changed for easier integration in the future. This does not affect backward compatibility.

Check the [status of development here](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/378929159/POW+N+066+Batch+of+transactions)

### Amount is passed as a string. Everywhere

Code became much simpler and it is easier to create transactions without SDKs now (#1555)

### Proto files were split

Client API proto files now are stored in a shared model folder, whereas as Iroha peer messages are stored in schema folder (#1550)

### GetAccountDetail is a bit more powerful now

Check [our documentation page](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/queries.html#get-account-detail) 

### GetPendingTransactions

In order to make scenarios related to transaction batches and multisignature transactions easier Iroha has API endpoint to get transactions of transactions batches which require signing by participating accounts (#1532)

**Important note:** this feature was not implemented completely in this release, however, interfaces and SDKs have already been changed for easier integration in the future. This does not affect backward compatibility.

### Deleted account_id from Add/SubtractAssetQuantity commands 

Finally, we have deleted account_id from a previously confusing API in #1511

### Roles can have an empty set of permissions 

Now users can create empty roles for use cases where such a role can serve a purpose of a tag or the least powerful role in the system (#1510)

Adds stateful validation checks for transaction batches:

1. If the transaction does not belong to any batch, proceed as usual
2. If the transaction belongs to ordered batch, in case of failure just move to the next transaction again
3. If the transaction belongs to atomic batch, failure of it leads to failure of all transactions in that batch

Also, tests for stateful validator and transaction batch validation were added.

### Benefits

Logic of transaction batches is improved.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Additional overhead for validation and WSV save points management.

### Alternative designs

Savepoint wrapper's design can be a theme of discussion. Shortly, I have decided to implement it as a nested structure of TemporaryWsv, because:
1. It cannot be used without temp WSV - there's just no sense in it
2. It must ""see"" some of private fields of temp WSV in order to function

There are two alternatives I see: declare it in some kind of temp WSV common file, and then either parametrize it with a template, or make necessary field of temp WSV friends to the wrapper. Both solutions, in my opinion, looks worse, than the one implemented",[],19,2018-07-10 09:39:54,2018-07-13 16:29:55,2018-07-13 16:29:59,True,2018-07-13 16:29:55,Akvinikym,unknown,,closed

Fuzz tests for:

This pr introduces 3 main prerequisite fixes:
- Reordering of *Validator ctor parameters, so that `FieldValidator` is the first one
- Reusing existing `FieldValidator` in SignableModelValidator
- `FieldValidator` can now has time provider other than `iroha::time::now`

And the main fix is for BlockValidator. It now performs time validation based on the block field, so it's possible to synchronize blocks after a time gap passed.

### Benefits

Probably faster `SignableModelValidator`, since it don't need to allocate field validator
Peers can synchronize ""expired"" (in terms of current time) blocks from the network

### Possible Drawbacks 

`BlockValidator` is allocated on each `BlockLoaderImpl::retrieveBlock` (should it be a class field?)
`BlockLoaderImpl` cannot be parametrized with `BlockValidator` (though it wasn't used)

### Usage Examples or Tests

### Description of the Change

The change introduces a way to compile docs permissions page automatically.
Now, `permissions.rst` should NOT be modified manually.

The compiler uses `csv` file as a source of permissions' description, notable information, and examples description.
The compiler automatically makes references to the glossary for the terms occurred in permissions' descriptions (like wiki engine). The same term within a single description would not be transformed to a reference more than once.
The compiler makes a reference to commands that are related to corresponding permissions.
The compiler automatically includes listings of python examples.


<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits

It is easier to maintain the long list of permissions in any table/sheet editor than edit very long `rst` source file.

Permissions page format can be easily changed via applying changes to compiler script.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

Potentially no beautiful architecture inside compiler scripts. It may become a subject of refactoring later on.

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

Please check already compiled page here https://html-drqyakiigy.now.sh/maintenance/permissions
(Navigation menu may be broken, most likely due to internal url rewrite rules of now.sh)

The other way is to compile docs locally - please check `docs/README.md` and issue `make permissions` before `make html`.

### Description of the Change

In chain validator we might need to check some logic on either EmptyBlock or Block types. Current interface of mutable storage does not allow that. To overcome this issue check method has been introduced which applies predicates logic on the block without actually applying the block to the storage.

### Benefits

We can validate block on storage without applying it

### Possible Drawbacks 

Probably we don't need check method to take AbstractBlock as parameter but use EmptyBlock instead.

### Description of the Change

Cache CLI input values to make it more convenient (#827).

There are two use cases. 

1. Make is possible to use default values provided during creation of a `iroha_cli::interactive::ParamsMap` - If a default value is provided (e.g. default host/port), that will be used when the user input is empty.
2. Cache any user inputs - When an input is captured for a parameter, that value is cached and displayed on the input prompt for that parameter. If the user input is empty, cache value will be used.

### Benefits

Get rid of annoying repeated host/port entries when attempting to send requests to Iroha (among other inputs) and make the CLI less frustrating to use.

### Possible Drawbacks 

There's no option to remove a cached value other than replacing it with a new value. However, the CLI doesn't allow empty inputs so this shouldn't be a problem.

### Usage Examples or Tests

#### Scenario 1 - Using default values

There's no user input for `Peer port (50051)`, default is used (prompt displays the default values).

### Description of the Change

Several people were confused with docs. I had to update this section + get rid of Codacy badge.

### Benefits

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1494,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1494,neewy,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0.0_beta-3,"In this release following changes were made:

## Experimental multi-signature transactions support

This is one of the most important features so far, since it allows integrators of Iroha to customise validation logic and may help people who want to have smart-contracts support. Let me tell you more:

As per definition of [multi signature account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisignature) on wikipedia, it is a type of account, which has a special condition, associated with the account: it is related to a number of cryptographic signatures required to issue valid transactions from the account, or ""quorum"". Quorum is a requirement to have M of N signatures, attached to transaction, where N is a total number of public keys associated with the account.

It helps to build following logic:
- in order to form a valid transaction a user of Iroha has to apply several keys distributed across several people or devices to her transactions
- in order to form a valid transaction a user of a service with Iroha may send her transactions to a service, which validates some custom logic (amount of transferred assets, special fields, whatever) and this service can add a signature to transaction if it passed custom validation 

What is different in Iroha, compared to other services, is that a user is able to send transactions to peer network which don't have all required signatures, ""half-baked"". Iroha puts them in a temporary storage and distributes across the network. In the end, when Iroha peer network has received enough ""half-baked"" transactions (quorum condition is valid) such transaction is sent to Iroha validation and is written in the ledger in case of successful validation. 

If you are curious — check code in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1260. Docs are going to be available gradually in our [documentation website](https://iroha.readthedocs.io). 

## Block streaming

This would allow people to create services around Iroha that can listen to events happening on the chain — like specific transactions. In the future, it would allow us to implement block explorer functionality as well.

### Description of the Change

The PR introduces Binary Testing Framework.
BTF allows performing stateful validation for transactions and queries built using client libraries. 
For now, only Python is supported. Java support will be added later on.

This PR comes with python scripts that cover all the set of Iroha permissions.

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits

Now here is the tool for stateful validation of transactions and queries created via client libraries.

Also, here is a set of python examples that shows how to use Iroha permissions model. (Scripts' listings will be included into ""permissions"" page at ReadTheDocs).

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks

No drawbacks were observed.

cmake --build build --target binary_test
cd build
ctest -R binary
```

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Possible Improvements

The existing set of python example scripts can be extended with tests which validate the correctness of resulting state after applying transactions to Iroha (that approach was not the point of current tests set).

Such improvement will require changes in the implementation of Python and Java launchers.

Add implementation of ordering service that managed by proposals by request.
Method of the work:
Each round we:
 * pack new proposal into unordered_map for sharing in the network;
 * erase old proposals;
 * collect transactions in the concurrent queue for further packing to the proposal in a next round.

Execution model:
Each network method may be called from concurrently, updates of invariant are covered by a write lock, rest by a read lock. `OnTransactions` may be called in different threads simultaneously.

Rounds:
We form proposal round as a pair [BlockRound, RejectRound], where the BlockRound is a number of blocks in the ledger + 1, RejectRound is a number of rejects + 1.
For example, first round in the network will be [2, 1].


### Benefits

One small step to BFT Iroha

### Possible Drawbacks 
The implementation doesn't contain tests.

### Reviewers notes

Pls, keep focusing on the following issues:
* redundant copies, especially, in the proposal generation
* race conditions
* imperative style - I hope, that you may suggest a more elegant solution.

So far bindings was quite messy and a lot of useless functions/types was shared. This pr aimed at cleaning sdk interface, particularly:

- Reusing existent type instead of `proto::Transaction::QuorumType`
- Ignoring functions in backend, that returns `boost::variant`
- Create wrappers for `proto::*::signatures()` (because `boost::any_range` cannot be used)

### Benefits

Lesser useless stuff in bindings

### Possible Drawbacks 

Code duplication in _bindings.i_ :( Feel free to propose a better solution

Transfering asset with non-zero precision causes writing to WSV amount without precision and that basically lead to the strange things.

Particularly amount at [this line](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1470/files#diff-61f63c72eb4f7dc6082d4c9a2a4f8b5cL451) isn't properly set because it's not adjusted to the proper precision.

### Description of the Change
Change YAC transport and interfaces:
 - Transport Commit and Reject messages replaced with State message
 - Single endpoint used to send state
 - Single methods to process state instead of 3 methods for vote, commit, and reject in YAC related classes
 - YAC interface returns outcome -- commit or reject, so it can be appropriately handled by consensus users
 - Commit/reject is passed to YAC subscribers only after receiving an appropriate message instead of a single vote [IR-1401](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1401)

### Benefits
 - Unified network interface which can be used by multiple propagation strategies like multicast or gossip
 - Simplified logic in transport, storage, crypto verifier, message handlers
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
 - More complex logic in YAC message handler -- probably it is possible to move it to separate class

### Note to reviewers
Since the pull request affects ~22~34 files, it may be difficult to review as a single change/pull request.
Each commit in this branch passes the tests, so it can be safely separated into multiple pull requests by request of reviewers.
Also you can consider reviewing separate commits, as they localize the changes to different entities, such as network notifications, crypto provider, storage, and YAC itself.

Ametsuchi uses enum-based permissions. WSV scheme is now unisng internal enum types. 

### Benefits

One more step toward legacy model removal.
Types introduction discovered that conversion between types was a bit messy, e.g check out that line:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/33f80ae9734251a92e9852fd31cb2ed309699fe4/irohad/execution/impl/query_execution.cpp#L73

Operations for PermissionSet are more efficient:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/33f80ae9734251a92e9852fd31cb2ed309699fe4/irohad/execution/impl/common_executor.cpp#L42

### Possible Drawbacks 

Additional string allocations in WSV (similar below):
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/33f80ae9734251a92e9852fd31cb2ed309699fe4/irohad/ametsuchi/impl/postgres_wsv_command.cpp#L90

Checking of number of permissions in the set can be messy and error prone:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/33f80ae9734251a92e9852fd31cb2ed309699fe4/test/module/irohad/ametsuchi/wsv_query_command_test.cpp#L139

Type creation is barely readable :(
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/33f80ae9734251a92e9852fd31cb2ed309699fe4/irohad/ametsuchi/impl/storage_impl.cpp#L306-L322

That might be not necessary (todo: check):

[IR-1223](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1223)

### Description of the Change

Previously, there was no possibility for client code to catch exceptions thrown by ModelCrypto::fromPrivateKey method, so type of exception was changed to std::invalid_argument.
Also, a check for equality between private_key argument's length and 64 was added with related exception throw in case of failure.
Lastly, a couple of new tests were written to test new functionality. 
Overall, this is remake of [old pull request](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1254), which was not fixed and merged.

### Benefits

The exception can now be caught by client's code

### Description of the Change
`withRegistry` wrapper used in `release-build.groovy` file prevented from executing experimental Docker commands. Namely, `docker manifest` that is used to manage manifest files on Docker hub. My suggestion is that this wrapper somehow fiddles with the system environment and shoves its own `config.json` without experimental features enabled.
This wrapper was redundant anyway as we use `withCredentials` to passthrough login and password for Docker hub.

### Description of the Change
- Getting started guide did not reflect changes required to run Iroha with Postgres. `config.sample` file from `example` directory uses `localhost` as a Postgres host Iroha should connect to. It actually should connect to the host matching Postgres container name.
- Removed block storage creation step as Docker creates it automatically on container start up.
- The other section suggested to override entrypoint and run Iroha manually. Rewrite it so Iroha uses entrypoint defined on Docker image creation. Supplement `docker run` command with `KEY` environment variable. That is to instruct Iroha container using keys from `example` directory.

### Description of the Change

Before BlockVariant was implemented via `using BlockVariantType=boost::variant<Block, EmptyBlock>`. This is not convenient in irohad because it forces to use visitors every time when it is needed to access BlockVariant's fields

Now it is a class which gives more convenient access to the fields in stored type

### Benefits

More convenient field access for BlockVariant

### Possible Drawbacks 

Multiple inheritance from boost::variant (to allow instantiation with either Block or EmptyBlock) and AbstractBlock (to guarantee AbstractBlocks interface)

Also, it used to return an optional value, which is now changed to exception throwing in case we meet unexpected class. 

### Benefits

- code becomes more logically structured
- no additional overhead during tests to get values from optionals

### Possible Drawbacks

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1392,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1392,tyvision,New CI pipeline,"## Description of the Change

This PR is created to finally make our CI satisfy proposed requirements by our developers team.
### 1 Major changes
#### 1.1 Pipeline stages
Since now, the Pipeline consists of 6 stages. You can see the ascii-art pipeline version in the `Jenkinsfile`

| Stage | Description |
|:--:|:---|
| Pre-build | Cancels previous build job (except if current branch is `develop`) |
| Build | Build step for all platforms (currently `ARMv7`, `ARMv8`, `x86_64`, `MacOS` are present) |
| Pre-coverage | Launch coverage target before running tests |
| Tests | Run required tests for specified platforms |
| Post-Coverage | Run coverage after tests step |
| Build rest | Build (if required): 1) documentation 2) bindings 3) release version of `iroha` |

This division is made to improve visibility of the CI build process.
Stage separation is implemented in Jenkinsfile. All stage methods are implemented in `.jenkinsci/debug-build.groovy`, `.jenkinsci/release-build.groovy`, `.jenkinsci/mac-debug-build.groovy`, `.jenkinsci/mac-release-build.groovy` (note that `MacOS` build goes on the physical machine, not in the docker container, that's why there's another file for `MacOS` platform)

#### 1.2 On-demand Jenkins agents

Since now `x86_64` agents are moved to AWS EC2. There are 4 different labels added to the pipeline (note that it could be easily modified in Jenkins configuration):
- `x86_64_aws_build` -- general purpose instance with 8 CPU, 32 Gb RAM (x86_64 builds in 8 threads)
- `x86_64_aws_test` -- general purpose instance with 1 CPU, 2 Gb RAM for running tests
- `x86_64_aws_cov` -- general purpose instance with 1 CPU, 2 Gb RAM for running coverage
- `x86_64_aws_sonar` -- general purpose instance with 1 CPU, 2 Gb RAM for running `sonarscanner`

Now, the amount of `x86_64` agents will be float, as their amount is managed by Jenkins.

> *Note:* With migration to Amazon AWS EC2 on-demand agents the logic of some methods has been changed. The text below describes this change.

**On-demand agent start-up process**
Before freshly created and launched new AWS instance becomes the Jenkins agent, init script is executed. It mounts 4 folders via NFS share (AWS EFS - Amazon Elastic Filesystem).
- Jenkins workspace (`/var/jenkins`)
- `cmake` build cache (`/opt/.ccache`)
- `cmake` release build cache (`/opt/.ccache-release`)
- docker images storage (`/tmp/docker`)

**On-demand agent pipeline lifecycle**
In case the build occures on the `x86_64*` agent, the created docker image (stage `Build`) is saved to AWS EFS (Amazon Elastic Filesystem) using `docker save -o` command with file name `/tmp/docker/<branch_name_sha1>`. (see file `.jenkinsci/docker-pull-or-build.groovy`, method `dockerPullOrUpdate()`). When going to the next stage, new `x86_64*` agent is created, docker image is loaded from the file `/tmp/docker/<branch_name_sha1>` using `docker load` command.

After the stage finishes, the docker container is stopped and removed, results are saved to the Jenkins workspace (and to the AWS EFS respectively), thus, none of the data is lost.

#### 1.3 Merge availability

To make CI available to perform automatic merge process the list of features should be implemented: 
- check merge requirements compliance
- merge strategy

Merge requirements set in `hyperledger/iroha` repository:
- at least 2 `APPROVED` reviews
- CI checks are passed (`armv7`, `armv8` are turned off in case of `MergePR` is chosen)
- all commits are `sign-off`

Merge strategy regarding the branches:
- `trunk` + `develop` -- `squash & merge`
- `master` -- merge

All checks are made using Github API. To see the implementation, go to `.jenkinsci/github-api.groovy` file.

> To merge, developer should go to ```Jenkins -> iroha -> iroha-hyperledger -> Pull Requests -> PR # -> Build with Parameters``` and set checkpoint for Merge_PR.

#### 1.4 CI notifications

Build result notifications were added. Table below describes the notification scenario:

|Scenario|Behavior|
|:--:|:--|
| Branch commit|sends e-mail to git commit author|
| Open or Commit Pull Request | posts comment with PR reviewers mention on the PR page |
| Merge to `trunk` | sends e-mail to git commit author |
| Merge to `develop` | sends e-mail to git commit author + Andrei + Fyodor |
| Merge to `master` | sends e-mail to iroha-maintainers team |

Notification e-mail contains compressed log in attachmens + build status.
see `.jenkinsci/notifications.groovy`,`Jenkinsfile` (cleanup post-step at the end of the file)

#### 1.5 Tests launch separation

This feature is implemented as a method that returns regex string (file `.jenkinsci/test-launcher.groovy`)
This method is called in the `Jenkinsfile` stage `Tests` and its return string is passed as a parameter to the `doTestStep()` method. More detailed description of test types execution according to the build strategy is provided in the next section (1.6)

#### 1.6 Default order of execution

Table contains requirements for order of pipeline execution. 

|Scenario|Build Behavior|Coverage|Tests|Packages|Docs|Bindings|
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Branch commit|x86_64 gcc-5.4 build|by request|`module` tests|by request|by request|by request|

### 2 Minor changes

- Fixed absence of `--output-on-failure` flag on `MacOS` tests.
- Modified post-step for whole CI allowed to fix execution logic
- Fixed clean-up procedures:
  - separated `linuxPostStep()` method from `jenkinsci/linux-post-step.groovy` into `postStep()` and `cleanUp()` methods. `postStep()` method is authoritative for uploading artifacts after release build, when `cleanUp()` removes folders created during builds
  - fixed the call cases for the `doDockerCleanup()`. Now this method been called only from the pipeline's cleanup post-step, at `armv7`, `armv8` agents.
  - fixed the stale docker images cleanup ([IR-1293](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1293), [IR-1451](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1451))
## Benefits
- reduced build time (~15-20 mins for branch commit, except branch commit with changes dockerfile, it takes additional 30-50 minutes)
- automatic merge by CI
- defined workflow that covers all scenario

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1375,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1375,stinger112,Add emscripted bindings,"### Description of the Change

This PR introduces a new way to build JS library for all platforms by Emscripten.

### Benefits

The first and the most important feature of this PR: we can use compiled library on almost **any** JS platform, particularly on modern **browsers**.
The second, but very important too: we can **sufficiently** decrease efforts to maintain the native code of the NPM package because we no need SWIG anymore!

### Possible Drawbacks 

Maintainers should spend some time to create and maintain *Embind* C++ bindings and JS wrapper code to properly build the lib for Emscripten.
Also, we should create some unit test to ensure binding correctness between C++ and JS types.
The third one drawback is a C++ type system. Not all types and semantic structures (e.g. template-based classes) can be easily turned to JS equivalents. It needs to be previously discussed before introduce such classes and methods to the Shared Library API. And, obviously, developers of Shared Library shouldn't overuse polymorphism.

### Usage Examples or Tests

This library is a drop-in replacement of the previous one. No additional changes in the existing application code needed.

### Alternate Designs

Alternate design can be implemented using WebIDL bind system instead Embind. More information you can find in the [**report**](https://gist.github.com/stinger112/c0ec155a0f4083dd7013d1dd027a6678).

### Additional

Working on this PR still in progress, but most of the functionality (including tests) already working.
Please, don't remove this PR. Thank you :)

### How to build

You can find an instruction with the related docker container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/stinger112/soramitsu/).

### TODOs

- [x] Create clean docker image with Emscripten's compilation environment
- [ ] Add correct memory management with **shared_ptr** and **deleteLater**
- [x] Add helper functions and classes to JS wrapper
- [x] Enable compiler optimizations
- [x] Actualize the code according actual **Shared Library** in develop
- [x] Cleanup code

### Description of the Change
Java bindings on Jenkins CI are generated with dynamically linked `libed25519.so`. End users do not necessarily have this library installed on the system. This makes Java bindings without `libed25519.so` not usable. This PR fixes this issue by removing ed25519 files from the system prior configuring the build with CMake.

### Alternate Designs 

The rest of ITF methods such as ""sendTx"" could also get the fix, but they are left without such check of null pointers as it was done inside ""done"" method by this fix.
**This is ok**, because ""done"" will be called automatically inside default ITF deleter passed to destructor and ""sendTx"" would not. 
Moreover, ""sendTx"" will generate an exception only in case of strict violation of ITF usage mechanism (calling ""sendTx"" without calling of ""setInitialState"").",[],1,2018-05-18 08:39:24,2018-05-18 09:15:57,2018-05-18 09:16:01,True,2018-05-18 09:15:57,igor-egorov,unknown,,closed

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1350,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1350,neewy,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0.0 beta-2,"In this release following changes were made:

## Uploading of Iroha build artifacts

Artifacts are now available on https://artifact.soramitsu.co.jp for downloading:
- macOS Iroha binary
- linux Iroha binaries
- Android, Java, Python bindings

In the following releases, more bindings are coming!  

## Fix of critical vulnerabilities discovered during the security audit

Previously, several problems existed:
- Blocks can be signed more than once by the same peer (fixed in #1193)
- Transactions can be signed more than once by the same signatory (fixed in #1302)

If ed25519 library was modified to use a non-deterministic nonce, these vulnerabilities were likely to be used. Thanks to @dhuseby who helped us to unveil this tricky part of ed25519.

## Message size

Previously, gRPC message was limited to 4MB. Regarding our release stage, we decided to get rid of this limitation. Right now anyone can send huge messages over the peer network. It is a potential attack vector, so we will fix it in following releases.

## Docker naming 

Our docker containers now are described here: https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/iroha/
Please use only them (our docs were also updated in #1337)

## Integration test framework

We fixed the indeterministic outcome of tricky tests, optimized their overall runtime by 15 times on macOS hosts and by 3 times on linux hosts (#1338)

## MSVC

Now our client library (shared model) can be built with Microsoft compiler, and respective tests can be built and ran in this environment. 

Hyperledger Iroha codebase MSVC support is coming in next releases.

## Genesis block generation from a transaction

`iroha-cli --genesis_block --genesis_transaction transaction.json` #1168 

## Error message to response, if stateless validation has failed

`ToriiResponse` has field `error_message` with the error description of a transaction
`ErrorResponse` has field `message` with the error description of a query
`QueryResponse` has hex-encoded query hash instead of binary hash

## Client libraries & shared model

Finished transition to shared model.
Transaction counter is no longer used in the transaction structure. Replay attacks are going to be prevented with transaction hash on peer side.

## Stability

A regular queue is replaced with a priority queue in ordering gate so that proposals are propagated in order to the system if they are received in random order from the network. That causes fewer issues with simulator warnings about last block height being inconsistent with proposal height.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed: streaming
- Fixed: boost linking
- Fixed: numerous synchronization issues
- Fixed: inconsistent genesis block generation
- Fixed: possible fork attacks
- Fixed: numerous permission issues
- Fixed: segfaults when the ledger doesn't contain blocks
- Fixed: numerous memory management issues
- Fixed: copyright and licensing issues (mostly)
- Other minor fixes

Nobody likes polymorphic wrappers, right? This is the first pull request in a series which will remove polymorphic wrapper from shared model, making clear `const iface &` return types.
There are several helper methods included for deserialization and visitation, so that polymorphic wrapper does not have to be removed from the whole project in one pull request, making a smoother transition.

### Assets

In this release following changes were made:

## Uploading of the build artifacts
Artifacts will now be available on https://artifact.soramitsu.co.jp for downloading
## Features
- genesis block generation from a list of transactions
#### How to use
`iroha-cli --genesis_block --genesis_transaction transaction.json` @l4l 
- Added: error message to response, if stateless validation has failed
#### How to use
`ToriiResponse` now has field `error_message` with the error description of transaction
`ErrorResponse` now has field `message` with  the error description of query
- QueryResponse now have hex-encoded query hashe instead of binary hashe
## Client libraries & shared model
  - Transaction counter is no longer used in the transaction structure
  - Full transition to shared_model 
## Optimisations
### Performance
- A Regular queue is replaced with a priority queue in ordering gate so that proposals are propagated in order to the system if they are received in random order from the network. That causes fewer issues with simulator warnings about last block height being inconsistent with proposal height.
### Other
- Python and Javascript bindings can be compiled at the same time

### Bugfixes
- Fixed: signature comparing
- Fixed: boost linking
- Fixed: numerous synchronization issues
- Fixed: inconsistent genesis block generation
- Fixed: possible fork attacks
- Fixed: numerous permission issues
- Fixed: segfaults when the ledger doesn't contain blocks
- Fixed: numerous memory management issues
- Other minor fixes

### Description of the Change
Introduce automatic updates of Docker manifest file with each push to Docker registry. Previously it was uploaded manually once (`docker/manifest.yaml`) using `manifest-tool` Go-written program. It was considered sufficient and assumed that each successive update of an image under some tag would update its parent reference. Turned out we must reupload manifest file with each push of the tag. Instead of using `manifest-tool` this PR exploits a new feature introduced in Docker 18. It allows to manipulate manifest file using Docker CLI itself.

### Description of the Change
New version of gRPC introduced another library file, which was not copied in Dockerfile. Any such change in gRPC will require manual maintenance of library list, which is not convenient. This pull request reverts gRPC installation logic to `cmake --target install`, so that all required libraries are installed independent of version.

### Description of the Change
- Rework GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT variable null-value check
- Fix Coverage stage run even it is supposed to be disabled
- Fix `parallelism` variable not set properly for ARMv7 platform builds
- Force checking `when` conditional prior occupying an agent

### Benefits
- Speed up builds for the first branch commit as we download Dockerfile from a correct URL the image for which is usually present on a FS
- Speed up builds by skipping over Coverage stage when not needed
- Speed up builds by not waiting in stages to check for `when` step results. E.g., ARMv7 is usually skipped but still requires to allocate an agent to execute `when` step. Not needed anymore.

### Description of the Change
- Rework Docker images naming scheme. Previously, it was ambiguous and did not reflect the contents of an image. Scheme now looks the following:
    - `iroha:latest` — master branch, image with Iroha installed
    - `iroha:develop` — develop branch, image with Iroha installed
    - `iroha:develop-build` — develop branch, image with dependencies for building Iroha
Naming scheme is described in `manifest.yaml` file. The file will be uploaded into Dockerhub after this PR is merged
- Remove Dockerfile division by platform (x86_64, ARM) as platform-aware dependencies are eliminated
- Postgres Docker container in debug build is now started along with Iroha build container, not separately. This simplifies tear-down procedure as Postgres container shuts down automatically
- Remove nightly build related scripts. Nightly build is now a separate job on Jenkins
- Rework Docker-compose file
- Increase log verbosity in case of failed tests

Fix issues with heap-use-after-free and `generateProposal` thread working after destructor.
 - `unsubscribe` call now blocks until a running method is completed

### Description of the Change

- ""Debug"" build type build followed by ""Release"" build in CI pipeline generates two sets of artifacts for each build type respectively. This PR disables artifacts generation for ""Debug"" build type so that they would not be uploaded to artifact server. We only want to have ""Release"" artifacts published.
- Include TAR packaged artifacts previously generated but not uploaded for Linux builds.
- Replace `cp` with `mv` to save some disk space used by a single build.

Introduce multisignature transactions support.
That pr should be merged only after:

- [x] merging of #1066
- [x] adding type for MstExpired in shared model (#1279)
- [x] reworking mst pipeline test with itf and enabling it (#1281)

### Possible Drawbacks 

The main codebase maybe unstable after merging, as long as that branch is really long-living

### Usage Examples or Tests

All tests related to transaction have been updated. So new transaction must contain quorum param, that by default is 1 (or bigger, if transaction should be multisig)

### Description of the Change
CI:
- added Android bindings generation. Based on [this script](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/e70649f7288499cd27a66788b06b3cc1706cb416/example/Android/android-build.sh). Dockerfile in `android/Dockerfile` contains instructions for building base image. Iroha itself then checked out into Docker container with necessary changes in `CMakeLists.txt`. Dockerfile supports building for multiple platforms, ABIs and build types (`PLATFORM`, `VERSION` and `BUILD_TYPE_A` variables respectively). Allowed parameters are defined in the beginning of Jenkinsfile as properties.
- rewrite Python and Java bindings generation. Added support for Python 2.7 as suggested by @l4l [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1170#pullrequestreview-109064226)
- rewrite [`dockerPullOrUpdate`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/fe0dd0ec77f871a778864fe904fd3ae6ac5695bc/.jenkinsci/docker-pull-or-build.groovy) function to support Docker images required to build bindings. Fix the function exit with an error in case Docker images is unavailable in Dockerhub. It now builds an image instead.

Regarding [forced dependencies resolving](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1170#issuecomment-378348753) by @l4l. [As explained](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1170#issuecomment-378573268) by @luckychess, appropriate protobuf version must be installed.
Regarding [ed25519 packaging](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1170#issuecomment-378348753). `libed25519`  is linked statically and not shown in the `ldd` output

#1179 is no more relevant

Upon successful build, bindings will be uploaded to [artifact server](https://artifact.soramitsu.co.jp) into `bindings` folder

### Description of the Change

The task is to hide SignatureSetType so that no one needs to deal with `PolymorphicWrapper<Signature>` outside of shared model

### Benefits

Polymorphic wrappers is used less outside iroha

### Possible Drawbacks 

None

### Alternate Designs

We also could have to keep unordered_set type for `signatures()` method, but that leads to unnecessary objects allocations

Unfortunately, the data used in the documentation are obsolete and have been supposed to be replaced before release of beta. We should not keep this metric for too long in public, as Iroha is expected to produce 3000 tx/s throughput on 7 nodes. As we are in the middle of update of Huawei Caliper's data then we need to finish it first and only then update data in docs.

### Description of the Change

Fixes problem of missed grantable permissions in proto file. 

Bug example:
User ""userone@domain"" wants to grant user ""usertwo@domain"" to add key value information. To do so ""userone@domaiun"" needed to grant ""can_set_my_account_detail"" permission to ""usertwo@permission"". But to do so user ""userone@domain"" needs permission ""can_grant_can_set_my_quorum"" which was missing before in proto files although existed in iroha.

### Benefits

Includes missing permissions to proto file.

### Possible Drawbacks 

None

### Usage Examples or Tests

tx-example.py has been updated to demonstrate granting permission to set account detail to another user, set it, and check if detail has been set.",[],2,2018-04-16 08:27:28,2018-04-21 16:34:40,2018-04-21 17:43:12,True,2018-04-21 16:34:40,kamilsa,unknown,,closed

### Description of the Change
Before this PR, Jenkins has been building Docker images prior running every build. The procedure is the following:
- forcibly build Docker image referenced by current commit. In majority of cases Docker reuses image layers local cache and simply tags already existing image
- in case any changes were introduced in Docker file, the image is rebuilt and used while building Iroha
- in case the current build is recognized as Master or Develop branch commit, resulting Docker image is uploaded to Dockerhub
The problem is that in the very beginning of Dockerfile we run `apt-get update` command followed by `apt-get upgrade`

```
RUN apt-get update; \
    apt-get -y upgrade; \
    apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install apt-utils software-properties-common; \
    apt-get -y clean
[snip]
```

Docker decides whether the `RUN` section is in cache or not totally depends on the similarity of commands, i.e. if no changes were introduced into a `RUN` section, Docker will reuse local cache. This works fine as long as we do not need to update `apt` cache. And sometimes we must do it because repositories are referenced by DNS names and not by IP addresses. However, those resolved domain names are stored in APT cache as IP addresses, which may become unavailable over time.
This leads to a situation when modified Dockerfile, that was added with additional packages installed from APT repositories cannot install them, as IP addresses not available any more. This requires APT cache to be updated with `apt-get update` command. And as Docker reuses local cache this operation will never run.
We can force Docker to always update cache before every build, but this leads to rebuilding the whole image, because `apt-get update` is the very first command in Dockerfile

This PR introduces a new mechanism for building Docker images during pipeline run. We compare Dockerfile of two consecutive commits: current and the previous one. If they differ, then simply rebuild an an image. Otherwise, reuse the image already built in the previous commit.

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
Docker images that are built during pipeline run will now avoid stale APT repositories, while still benefit from already built images during previous pipeline runs.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
This may increase pipeline run time in cases a Dockerfile has been changed as we now do not use local layer cache, but rebuilding the entire image. But doing so allows to avoid stale APT repositories, which would have failed a build anyways.

I do believe that we have to design a common protocol for the Hyperledger Fabric and Iroha. The idea of 2 phase commit seems relevant as we could connect the two ledgers through a common connector which could be linked through the same set of checks. Moreover, Hyperledger Fabric offers a modular architecture for the network designers to plug in their preferred implementations for the components.
There would a common business network for both of them and each main chain operates one or multiple applications/solutions validated by the same group of organizations. Separate Confidential chains should  be built for each of them.

There won't be any need for multiple signatures for making a transaction as there would be confdential chaincode transaction where Validators will only be able to decrypt it. There are different sets of Peers, Proxy Peers, Endorsers and Validators for the peer review of any transactions. Hence, we could think of inter ledger transactions in this way.

Inter-chain transactions and Inter Network transactions can be  made possible between two main networks and between two confidential chains respectively. Chaincodes in a confidential chain can trigger transactions on one or multiple main chain(s).

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1144,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1144,neewy,Hyperledger Iroha v1.0 beta release,"After beta release, we are moving to the schema of time-based releases, and it is expected to release approximately every month.

In this release following changes were made:

## Client libraries & shared model

Our long road, taking its start from a decision made back in October 2017 about using in Iroha daemon a set of _shared_ model classes with invariants, validators, protobuf as a backbone, clear and intuitive validation output, used both on client side and on server side is coming to its end with a release of libraries for several platforms:
* Obviously, C++ 
* Java & Android in particular
* Python

_Shared model_ name means that exactly the same Transaction, Query, etc. objects are used on client and peer side for the purpose of improved reliability and user-friendliness. We are approaching the end of complete migration to these classes (it appears that we will ship it in next release).

A shared model name is going to change to _irohalib_ for a better consistency with UNIX naming style (as Iroha binary is named as irohad).

All libraries except C++ are generated using SWIG — which means that their maintenance is guaranteed by an effective CI pipeline that we are going to build in the future.  So far, libraries are available in several external repositories (Maven, PIP, etc.) and their update is going to be automated in following releases as well.

Swift & Objective-C library is available is a preview state, since there are issues with tests, documentation, and Objective-C code.

NodeJS library is also available in a preview state, though it has tests and documentation for it.

Please, use our documentation related to client libraries on ReadTheDocs service, which is explained below:

## Documentation

Previously, documentation for the project was discrete and was placed in several places, moreover, it was targeted only at developers.

We are changing the focus by telling more people in different languages about key features of Iroha, and the level of technical expertise required to read the docs is varied from integrators or explorers to blockchain developers. 

Check out our new docs at iroha.readthedocs.io (being still translated and changed). 
Please, contribute to the translation of docs [here on POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/SFpZw7o33o).

## Project distribution

One of SnapCraft maintainers, @elopio, has recently contributed with a setup of snap package or Iroha. Please stay tuned as we will publish information on how to use snap right after release. 

As usual, anyone can download docker image and deploy Iroha in a container — check [Getting Started section](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/). 

In the future, all builds are going to be stored at https://artifact.soramitsu.co.jp/ page.

## Stateless validation

We have changed rules for our transaction, query, etc. schemas to be valid by unifying stateless validation rules. Please check [Core Concepts](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_concepts/) page of ReadTheDocs, where it is explained what is exactly stateless validation, and how certain fields are validated.

## Integration Test Framework

Acceptance tests are written using Integration Test framework, allowing to set up a context for a transaction pipeline in an easy way. This framework is capable of performing checks all along the pipeline and is reducing code duplication greatly. Readme file explaining ITF is going to be written soon, but for now, please [explore the code](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/develop/test/framework/integration_framework/integration_test_framework.hpp) — it is well documented and there are already tests written, and some of the [tests are already reported](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/299958273/Acceptance+Tests) (acceptance testing is now in progress).

## Ansible deployment

Now, Ansible playbook improvements allow you to deploy Iroha easily on many physical machines or in many docker containers on a fixed amount of machines to simulate different network configurations. More information is available in README.md file of deploy/ansible folder.

## Torii

Optimizations are now all along the code of our frontend gRPC component (named Torii). Moreover, clients now are not forced to pull the status of a transaction, but instead, they can use pull-based notification mechanism (gRPC Streaming). Check client libraries section for more examples and information. 

## Optimisations

### Reduced amount of project dependencies
* Redis component was removed completely, and PostgreSQL indices are used instead
* Using platform-independent file operations for better portability (still no Windows, sorry)
* Removed legacy code (old tests, crypto files, old schema files)

### Performance
* Added a queue at Ordering Gate — which means that proposals are now waiting in line to be sent to Ordering Service
* Improved performance of Ordering Service component 500 times after removing Proposal copying
* Initial performance testing for 4, 16, 28, 64 nodes

### Other
* Improved line coverage (command executor, Yet Another Consensus)
* Removed nonstd::optional (we are using boost::optional now)
* Clang formatting as a CMake function
* Improved logging
* Tests (more negative test cases, a whole new system test)
* Fixed memory leaks in Torii component
* Secured private keys with a passphrase for a safe storage on HDD

## Bugfixes
* Allow querying all account data
* Ninja build
* CLI improvements (still, it is better to write a new one, but we are supporting what we have at the moment)
* YAC peer order was fixed
* Startup of Ordering Service
* Fixed back pressure on fast proposal emitting",[],906,2018-03-28 14:35:17,2018-03-30 17:36:27,2018-12-29 11:13:10,True,2018-03-30 17:36:27,tyvision,unknown,,closed

### Description of the Change
Moves `YacHash` and `YacHashProvider` to the new model.
Due to the fact that I split moving consensus to the new model in 4 Pull Requests, `VoteMessage` will be migrated in the last PR. So this check will be removed in the last one.

### Benefits

Managment of container environment comes more clear and intuitive.

#### Each user within a system can run own docker container
Now `${UID}` is actually attached to containers' and network names as it was initially designed.
Moreover, there will be no collision between ports which are used on a host system by different containers. The script `run-iroha-dev.sh` now automatically chooses free port from predefined ranges - 50051-50101 for Iroha and 20000-20100 for a debugger.

#### Introduced script for full shutdown of container environment - stop-iroha-dev.sh
If you want to reinitialize or just shutdown container environment, then you can run stop-iroha-dev.sh and script will stop Iroha and Postgres containers, remove them and the network.
_Note that containers of other users will be left untouched._

#### Now it is possible to reenter into the container without its recreation
Launching of run-iroha-dev.sh several times in a row will lead to the creation of container environment at the first time and enter into it, all the next launches will lead only to reentering into the existing environment.

#### run-iroha-dev.sh reports ports used on the host system for Iroha and debugger

You will be provided with the information what ports are used for Iroha and debugger when you enter the container via launching run-iroha-dev.sh. This information will be shown in both cases - environment creation or just reentering into an existing environment.

### Possible Drawbacks 

The scripts need to be tested on macOS. There should be no issues, but development was done on Linux host.
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests

`./scripts/run-iroha-dev.sh` - for environment creation and enter into it. If environment already exists you will be just attached to its bash console.

`./scripts/stop-iroha-dev.sh` - stop Iroha and Postgres containers, destroy them, and destroy the network that was established for the environment.

This pull request eliminates overloading of generateKeypair() function (renames one of overloads to fromPrivateKey).

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
For languages which don't support function overload (like Javascript) behaviour is unspecified in general. In case of Javascript it resulted in impossibility to access generateKeypair(seed). Swig does not contain any documented ways to deal with this issue.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*
1. Just override copy() - this approach will hide base.
2. copy() returns unique_ptr<Base> - static_cast needed every time.
3. The same as implemented, but use method instead of function - less general and need to hide base method in every class in hierarchy of shared_model.

### Description of the Change
#### Jenkinsfile
- Fix ccache not being used during builds on MacOS
- Fix full path to binaries being used instead of relative ones on MacOS. Jenkins now complements PATH with additional lookup paths
- Fix post step may stuck forever on random builds. It now has a timeout. Post step will be forcibly terminated after a certain timeout (60s)
- Fix `cppcheck` target enabled even when coverage is disabled for that build
- Fix local `parallelism` param in Groovy build scripts was always null on the FIRST build. It is a known  [Jenkins bug](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41929)

**[UPD]**
- FIx dependencies in release Dockefile not installed properly

### Description of the Change
This PR introduces NPM package called **iroha-lib**.
It contains an implementation of the shared library for NodeJS, package's build and deploy systems and also a bunch of Iroha fixes, allowing to build **iroha-lib** on Mac and Linux.

Huge thanks to @haojun, @laSinteZ, and @luckychess for help in implementing of this.

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
This allows build and install Iroha library by NPM, so we can use it in Node.js 
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
This is a deep pre-alfa version of the lib, so it can contain some errors, however, I didn't find any.
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*
You can watch examples in two places:
1. *shared_model/packages/javascript/example* contains example code distributed with NPM package to test it after installing by `npm install iroha-lib`
2.*example/node* contains working application and some instructions how to run it. This app use **iroha-lib** package.

Now example code in both cases is equal, but it uses for different purposes.  

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*
I had tried to implement build system using NPM packages like **cmake-js** or **node-cmake**, but these technologies seem not very mature yet. Building by such packages allows avoid using **node-gyp**, so we can seamlessly integrate CMake-based build system of Iroha with **iroha-lib** package.

This pr adds relevant iroha use cases. Please review and pay attention to huge introduction section. I describe more in Possible Drawbacks. 

### Benefits

Documentation with relevant use cases. 

### Possible Drawbacks 

The introduction to the use cases is somewhat big. Although, it is not directly relevant to use case section, it provides useful context for it. We need to think what can we do with it, maybe we can move part of the introduction section to other docs?

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

- Created 2 playbooks:
    - playbook (`iroha-standalone-nodes`) deploys 1 iroha+postgres container to each node 
    - playbook (`iroha-docker-cluster`) deploys `N` instances or iroha+postgres to each node using generated `docker-compose.yml` file, where `N` could be specified for each node.
- Changed `docker` role: now `docker-compose` is also installed on target hosts
- Added possibility of rearranging mapped `torii` and `iroha` port in playbook. 
- Automated generation of `peers.list` based on inventory file (stored locally on host where ansible is launched).
- Automated generation of configuration files required for iroha to start: `config.sample`, `genesis.block`, `nodeX.pub`, `nodeX.priv`.  (stored locally)
- Now not only node-specific keypair is distributed to the iroha node.
- Separated roles: there are separated roles to generate files for each node and to deliver them and launch iroha. 
- Changed `ansible.cfg`: acceleration option enabled.
- Added roles and playbook documentation

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
- less handwriting (most of the files are generated automatically by this playbook) 
- increased flexibility as new configuration options added

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->
`iroha-cli` (required by roles that generate files locally) built from latest `develop` does invalid `genesis.block` generation:
```

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<std::out_of_range> >'
  what():  bimap<>: invalid key
```
message is displayed.

We compile cmake manually in dev docker, it uses internal libcurl without SSL. Because of this, #1070 build step on circle ci fails with `log: Protocol ""https"" not supported or disabled in libcurl`.

To fix this I:
- install `libcurl` with `openssl` support.
- I compile cmake with `--system-curl` option, to force cmake use libcurl with ssl cupport

Also, since we use SWIG and it requires cmake 3.7+, I update cmake version to 3.7.2.

Iroha bindings build script for Android

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
If you want to use Iroha bindings in Android you need to have libirohajava.so native library and a set of .java files. It's quite tricky to build them because shared library should be native for a target Android architecture. With this script build process becomes an easy thing.

### Description of the Change
This PR contains the first attempt to introduce [Hunter](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/) - package manager for CMake projects.
Specifically, it presents Hunter configuration and Boost as the first hunterized dependency.

UPD(@warchant): 
- to check that everything works correctly, `build-clean` is added to circle CI.
- cache hunter directory in Circle CI (TODO: upload build artifacts to https://github.com/soramitsu/hunter-binary-cache)



### Benefits
With current `ExternalProject`-based dependency handling we can't get an external project in config time, so we can't guarantee successfulness of its build and even don't know correct paths needed before build-time.
The use of **Hunter** in Iroha building process can sufficiently clarify project dependencies and allow to avoid custom **Find\*.cmake** modules. Also, it has many features like a cache hit, local binary cache, transparent config file that describes dependencies and so on.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
Despite Hunter in active dev/maintaining stage, it yet another third-party dependency in Iroha on which we will rely. @Warchant have some research about it and team decide to try Hunter on some Iroha dependencies to clarify drawbacks.
Also, we need to think about usage Hunter in the case of making **Shared Model** as separate CMake project. I guess in such case we would need to use Hunter twice.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

```

```
UPD(@stinger112 27.03.18)
Now Hunter is optional so you must do:
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DHUNTER_ENABLED=ON
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target test
```

- Findgrpc.cmake: add missing `gpr_LIBRARY`, improve readability
- Findprotobuf.cmake: improve readability
- develop/Dockerfile: 
   - add `set -e` to make docker image build fail, if any of commands fail. 
   - add ldconfig to every step (grpc depends on protoc, which depends on libprotoc.so, without ldconfig protoc can not find libprotoc.so). 
   - it turned out that `sh` has no `lib{gpr,grpc,grpc++,grpc_plugin_support}.so` and I was forced to explicitly copy libs one-by-one.

### Description of the Change

Significant changes in Jenkinsfile and CI pipeline overall:
- Jenkinsfile is complemented with support for new platforms: armv7, armv8, MacOS
- Debug and Release builds are now separate groovy scripts executed in parallel on different platforms
- Dockerfiles are now compliant with the platform requirements (e.g., armhf version of Docker for armv7). Dockerfiles have also been added with additional packages: newer version of lcov, updated platform detection scripts, Cobertura converter tool
- Docker images stored on Dockerhub are moved to a new repository -- hyperledger/iroha
- Manifest file is created to support multiplatform Docker images (i.e., Docker image can now be simply pulled as `docker pull hyperledger/iroha:latest` or `docker pull hyperledger/iroha:develop` and target platform will be automatically detected. See `docker/manifest.yaml`)
- Introduced options to build bindings. Not working at the moment on all platforms due to environment variables discovery issues (e.g., JAVA_HOME which for some reason is always empty)
- Ansbile inventory is complemented with nodes we are using for running CI pipelines

There are 3 kinds of Docker images this PR implements, distinguished by tags:
- `:develop` -- a Docker image which refers to `develop` branch of this repo and synced to respective Dockerfile (`docker/develop/{platform}/Dockerfile`). Contains the environment and toolkit needed to compile Iroha. Every commit to that branch invokes building of that image and pushing it to Dockerhub.
- `:latest` -- a Docker image which refers to `master` branch of this repo. The DEB package of Iroha is built on every commit to the master branch using `:develop` Docker image and wrapped into a slim image containing a runtime environment only (see `docker/release/{platform}/Dockerfile`)
- `:{platform}-develop-latest` -- a not yet described image in `manifest.yaml` file which is why should be referred by pointing out a target platform for now. A Docker image which refers to `develop` branch of this repo. Works similarly to `:latest` tag but on every commit to develop branch. An image contains installed DEB package of Iroha which is synced with the code in develop branch.

<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
- Extended support for platforms we have not tested previously
- Docker manifest file hides differences in platforms

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
- Tests do not support setting Postgres DB name with environment variable. The workaround introduced in this PR is to create separate instance of Postgres listening on different ports. For now this is just a single port 5433 that should not clash with default Postgres port 5432. In case we ever run concurrent builds on a SINGLE Mac machine we should dynamically detect next available port and run separate DB instance on it. It is suggested to add support for passing DB name as an environment variable

### Benefits

- Docstrings are added to public methods of ITF.
- Destruction of ITF now will cause call of done (dropStorage) if no custom deleter was provided.
- Added regression test that uses the rest previously unused ITF methods.
- Added test for sequential initialization of two Iroha instances (test simulates the crash of the first instance - ITF destructed without a call of done).
- Added test for double call of done.

### Benefits
Possibility to request detail data added from other accounts. Also retrieving a whole details JSON in a single request could be more convenient to clients than to do a request for every key.

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->
Behaviour of query was changed so old code which uses getAccountDetail becomes broken.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*
Check kv_storage_test. Also simple example for Java:
In genesis block:
```
{
 ""command_type"": ""SetAccountDetail"",
 ""account_id"": ""admin@test"",
 ""key"": ""pog"",
 ""value"": ""champ""
 }
```
In some .java file:
```
...
UnsignedTx utx = txBuilder.creatorAccountId(""admin@test"")
            .createdTime(BigInteger.valueOf(currentTime))
            .txCounter(BigInteger.valueOf(startTxCounter))
            .setAccountDetail(""admin@test"", ""lol"", ""kek"")
            .setAccountDetail(""admin@test"", ""kek"", ""lol"")
            .build();
...
UnsignedQuery uquery = queryBuilder.creatorAccountId(creator)
            .queryCounter(BigInteger.valueOf(startQueryCounter))
            .createdTime(BigInteger.valueOf(currentTime))
            .getAccountDetail(""admin@test"")
            .build();
...
```
Expected result:
```
Query responsed:
Detail = {""genesis"": {""pog"": ""champ""}, ""admin@test"": {""kek"": ""lol"", ""lol"": ""kek""}}
```

This pull request brings the hierarchy of documentation related to Iroha in order to move forward with the release. Documentation structure was decided in issue #976 and was elaborated in order to fit it better to the project needs.

- Overview section contains project mission, depicts the vision of it, and comparison with other projects.
- Getting started is a short 10-20 minutes guide about how to use Iroha and boost an interest of people in learning or using it.
- Use cases is a discussion about the scenarios, which are suitable for the system so that people can understand where it is used.
- Core concepts explain how the system works in simple words: things like synchronization, consensus, internal schema of objects: this should be told in simple words so that a reader can understand the context better. The glossary is a separate page for every specific terminology used so that it is a central place to review terminology used in the project.
- Guides are how-tos for developers, who are building their applications around Iroha, in a detailed way, but not as detailed as API reference below. Guides answer exact questions and usually are formed to the needs of people, acting as a FAQ catalog.
- API reference is a detailed description of internal and external API used: errors, tx statuses, client libraries interface description, etc.
- Maintenance section is about how to create the environment for Iroha network to be stable, secure and easy to maintain.
- Contribution part explains the community how we work and how they may join the project, what are the communication channels.

Please, before reviewing the pull request check how to build the project locally and try to do it yourself.

### Benefits

In the future, RTD docs are going to be a central place for the public documentation available to everyone. It has versioning, it is widely available and ReStructuredText syntax rocks 🎸 👹 

### Possible Drawbacks 

Now the documentation is not separate from the project, and at some point, it might be a drawback. Also, maybe the theme used is not very cool?

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Please open README.MD file in the folder in order to understand how to build the project locally.

### PS

One can find the documentation to be ambiguous, not matching the needs of the project or just dislike it. This is completely fine if the argumentation is clear and addresses real issues, like grammar or logic flaws. Documentation is a weak point now, and the pull request should not be blocked by a long discussion since the structure was already decided in the issue. In the future, corrections are welcome and visual improvements are especially awaited, but for now, let's start with what we have 🙇 ",[],1,2018-03-06 06:08:44,2018-03-08 03:51:39,2018-03-08 03:51:56,True,2018-03-08 03:51:38,neewy,unknown,,closed

### Description of the Change

QueryService performs redundant operations. Particularly, the following part of the code contained problems:

https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/def7bc4f7efdf0c2d1c3caecccd2cf3efe0c889e/irohad/torii/impl/query_service.cpp#L53-L77

1. Here on line 60 response's status is set to `STATELESS_INVALID` but this status is not put into cache, whereas response variable is overwritten on line 74 by previous response for the same query hash.
2. On line 64 empty response was put into cache.
3. On line 73 value of optional is taken without checking its existence
4. No tests reflected aforementioned issues
 
### Benefits

All problems above were fixed.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Now if after query is passed into `QueryProcessor::queryHandle` method, but afterwards corresponding query response is not in the cache(empty optional is returned from cache_), query service will return `NOT_SUPPORTED` status.

### Usage Examples or Tests

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/1032,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1032,l4l,Tests for GetTransactions query,"### Description of the Change

Tests for GetTransactions query:

- query self tx without **can_get_{my,all}_txs** perms
- query self tx with **can_get_my_txs**
- query self tx with **can_get_all_txs**
- query inexistent hash
- query other user tx

Moreover there's additional fixes, so most of the tests are passing (or looks quite better):
- making ITF consts public
- create admin account with `all_perm_group` (otherwise no permission for user creation)
- builder for new user with specific permissions (can be useful in other queries tests)
- type checker for `ErrorQueryResponse` (can be useful in other queries tests)
- `SpecifiedVisitor`, which casts variant to optional of specified type (can be useful for most of the shared_model types usage)

Change all constructors in `shared_model/protobuf/*`:

```patch
       explicit AddAssetQuantity(CommandType &&command)
-          : CopyableProto(std::forward<CommandType>(command)),
-            add_asset_quantity_(proto_->add_asset_quantity()),
-            amount_([this] {
-              return proto::Amount(add_asset_quantity_.amount());
-            }) {}
+          : CopyableProto(std::forward<CommandType>(command)) {}

-      const iroha::protocol::AddAssetQuantity &add_asset_quantity_;
+      const iroha::protocol::AddAssetQuantity &add_asset_quantity_{
+          proto_->add_asset_quantity()};
 
-      const Lazy<proto::Amount> amount_;
+      const Lazy<proto::Amount> amount_{
+          [this] { return proto::Amount(add_asset_quantity_.amount()); }};
```

Because of the initialization order:
1) constructors of base classes
2) constructors of derived class
3) members 

It is better to move callbacks to lazy initializers as `non-static data member with initializer`.

It allows to make constructors simpler.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

This allows me to remove templated constructors (https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1020) in further optimizations.

All constructors in `shared_model/protobuf/*` now look like
```
template <typename CommandType>
explicit AddAssetQuantity(CommandType &&command)
: CopyableProto(std::forward<CommandType>(command)) {}
``` 

and they can  be easily changed to accept according protocol objects.

### Possible Drawbacks

### Description of the Change

<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

Move `HashType` and `BlobType` from `Hashable` to `common_objects/types.hpp`.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

Because Hashable is a template, you need weird constructions like https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1022/files#diff-f5da1abc9499e5ab936bf6172f85dbb6L71 to actually access the type. Also, what if you want to access this type from some other type, which does not have Hashable as its base class? You simply can't.

Now you can just include header and use it.

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

None.

This pull requests brings prettified file permissions.hpp, refactored order in primitive.proto and addition of domain-related permissions to the primitive.proto and pb_command_factory. The order is persistent across modified files, so it is convenient now to check what is the status of permissions.

### Benefits

Now genesis block has almost all possible permissions in it. The code looks a bit better.

### Possible Drawbacks 

1. Genesis block was modified manually. CLI code has to be modified as well.
2. Grant permission for TransferAsset is not checked.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

pb_commands_tests.cpp
CommandTest, create_role

I also executed a manual test against modified genesis.block, and it works.

Pass to dependencies:
- compiler generator
- launcher C, CXX (for ccache)
- add gpr lib to packaging, it is used by `grpc`
- remove grpc++_reflection from packaging -- we do not use it.

Change library output path to ${CMAKE_BUILD_DIR} -- means that all external libs will be compiled in `build` directory so we do not need to write full path to these libs.

Fix identations.

**Note**: `iroha_get_lib_name` only does preformatting of library name.
```
Example:
iroha_get_lib_name(OUT iroha SHARED) -> OUT=libiroha.so
iroha_get_lib_name(OUT iroha STATIC) -> OUT=libiroha.a
```

### Description of the Change
As it was pointed out in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/983 , `-g` flag increases binary size, which leads to CircleCI container running out of memory. This pull request removes `-g` flag from coverage builds, allowing CircleCI to pass compilation.

This PR introduced customized FindSWIG CMake module. It pulls and builds an appropriate version of SWIG and allow using it in the build system to generate bindings for a target language.

### Benefits
For now, if you want to compile any example or client library for target language you must clone, build, patch and install SWIG manually. Also, you need to choose a particular version of SWIG that supports by the client library. This PR adds more automatization to this process allowing don't have installed version before building the project by CMake.

### Possible Drawbacks 
Every customized module can be hard to maintain because their functionalities mostly based on existing find modules. Also, without tests coverage, it can be hard to check build success on different platforms.
Besides except SWIG library user must install additional dependencies for target language on his system. 

### Usage Examples or Tests
1. Set build configuration (e.g. for *python*)
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DSWIG_PYTHON=ON -DSHARED_MODEL_DISABLE_COMPATIBILITY=ON
```
2. Build project. It starts cloning and building SWIG
```
cmake --build build/ --target irohapy -- -j""$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)""
```

### Additional Information

There are currently 2 types of builders - common builder, which performs validation and returns interfaces, and concrete builders (currently protobuf ones), which create a specific implementation of an object for given shared_model implementation.

Common builders are parametrized by a concrete builder so that you can select implementation of your interfaces and mock concrete builders.

### Benefits

This introduces a safe way to construct basic shared_model objects and can be used when we want to instantiate these objects from arbitrary data, such as after taking them from the database.
<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

Increased complexity
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

Builder usage should be intuitive since it is a pretty common design pattern. Test examples can be seen in corresponding directories.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

Instead of template parametrization, inheritance could be used, where we either inject implementation or just provide a pure virtual interface for builders. However dynamic polymorphism is not useful here, since dynamic dispatch is not needed, and templates, allow us to use specific builders as well as common ones interchangeably.

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/961,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/961,Warchant,[WIP] Hunterize iroha,"# Motivation
Current approach with dependencies is bad, because we are forced to hardcode paths for libs and include headers. This is error prone is some toolchains, such as XCode, which we need to support.
The solution we've selected is [Hunter](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter) -- CMake-only script, which manages all dependencies in configuration time.

# Comments

- **This trunk and PR is used to test CI and keep track of progress**. 
- **do not push directly to this branch**, only via PRs. 

After we finish hunterization of all dependencies, we will forget about headache with them forever.
This is a good way to manage dependencies and good chance to upgrade their versions to the latest.

# Current state

This branch will be used as trunk. This trunk will be merged into develop as soon as all dependencies will be hunterized. 

Please do not update the following list by yourself. It helps to keep track of tasks required to finish migration to Hunter.

List of dependencies. (x - hunterized, empty - not hunterized)
- [ ] protobuf
- [ ] postgresql + pqxx
- [ ] grpc
- [x] rapidjson 1.1.0
- [x] boost 1.65.1
    - [x] filesystem
    - [x] system
    - [ ] spirit
- [x] gtest and gmock 1.8.0
- [ ] gflags 2.2 - needs to be tested, may be buggy, so probably we will need to hunterize different version.
- [ ] c-ares
- [x] spdlog 0.13 -- but we need 0.16, so we need to hunterize new version.
- [ ] rxcpp
- [ ] ed25519 -- repository hyperledger/iroha-ed25519 is ready to be hunterized
- [ ] tbb
- [ ] optional (martinmoene)
- [ ] swig
- [ ] google benchmark

Also, all CI systems and scripts should be cleaned and fixed:
- [ ] CircleCI
- [ ] Jenkins

# Other changes

- organize cmake files and scripts in better structure
- add new configuration type `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage`, which adds necessary flags to collect more quality coverage metrics
- add ccache support for XCode
- add hunter binary cache: 
    Now you can specify 2 environment variables: `GITHUB_USER` with your username and `GITHUB_USER_PASSWORD` with your personal access token with permission `public_repo`, then specify `cmake .. -DHUNTER_RUN_UPLOAD=ON` and it will download, build and upload binary files to https://github.com/soramitsu/hunter-binary-cache . Cache hit will be if and only if hunter version, toolchain and architecture are same.
- fix bug in `clang-format` target: it fixed by mistake all files inside `external` directory.
- update minimal required cmake to 3.7",['Warchant'],1,2018-02-09 16:40:17,2018-02-20 13:10:12,2018-03-28 07:58:14,False,,,dirty,False,closed

This error is a spdlog error.
This was solved with the following PR.
https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/pull/436

The version of spdlog in iroha docker / dependences does not follow this PR, so I fixed this.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
Compiling spdlog in alpine environment becomes possible.

This error is a spdlog error.
This was solved with the following PR.
https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/pull/436

The version of spdlog in iroha docker / dependences does not follow this PR, so I fixed this.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
Compiling spdlog in alpine environment becomes possible.

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/950,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/950,l4l,Rework OrderingService with new model,"### Description of the Change

Change OrderingServices' interfaces to the new shared model

### Issues

There's some issues that've been solved as simple as possible, though it's probably not really a good solution

#### iface -> proto

There's need to convert `proto::Proposal` to `protocol::Proposal`, it's pretty easy to set all the fields via builder but transactions. SM's proposal returns an interface, so there's no simple way to convert to protobuf, so I just use `makeOldModel` + `from_old`:

https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/5b711d1d7348f853ab8cda74e4b5b87207a24198/irohad/ordering/impl/ordering_service_transport_grpc.cpp#L61-L71

#### Pretty hard to create a simple tx

I guess the example is self-explainable

https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/5b711d1d7348f853ab8cda74e4b5b87207a24198/test/module/irohad/ordering/ordering_service_test.cpp#L82-L89

#### tbb queue wrapper

The tbb's concurrent queue can't work with interfaces (and even with `unique_ptr`), so I just used `shared_ptr` instead. Imo that can be a significant performance issue

### Description of the Change

A bad thing about smart pointers is they may store nullptr. In project we may guarantee that smart pointer has valid value inside. For purposes where there is no guarantee we should change type to Result<smart_pointer, error>. And this type explicitly say that there is possible null value.

This Pr fixes the problem above in /iroha/irohad/ametsuchi/impl/storage_impl.cpp

### Benefits

null pointers are explicitly processed

### Possible Drawbacks 

in several places, auto type deduction can't be used as
`auto p = ...` is substituted with `type p; match([]() { p = ... }) `

Streaming grpc call for transaction statuses.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
We want to have a push-based notifications for tx statuses so here we are.

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->
Each streaming call can theoretically block one of grpc thread up to a second. This timeout can be decreased in a least 10 times but it allows to start streaming call before transaction sending.

Two tests were added to torii_service_test.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->
Two main possibilities were checked: use combined Torii request which will return stream of responses or use separate calls for that (the second one was actually implemented). The first approach was faced with thread-related difficulties (kick me and I explain details).

This change is one of the several changes to provide better error messages to end users and developers. It does so by introducing Result class to PostgresWsvCommand, which allows us to specify what exactly went wrong during execution of the command.


### Benefits
1. Better error messages, in case any Postgres command fails
2. Cleaner code in command_executor

### Possible Drawbacks 

1. Queries still return optional, so code is inconsistent.
2. Increased size of the postgres_wsv_command
3. More tests need to be added to verify error messages

cppclean has found many issues (https://hackmd.io/IYTmBNwRmAGBaATANgOwICzIMaPgDgDMBWBfbYDAI1gGZbgrFag=?view). 

I spent around 6-7 hours to fix some. Here is the result: https://hackmd.io/KYNgrAjGDMAmDGBaUxiICwCYAMtEA5tp9EBDdAMxwCMBOCbMeCoA?view


Here is the diff:
https://www.diffchecker.com/Nl5cxDew

You may notice that some new issues are added, but do not worry, many of them are false-positives and there are no other way to fix the issue.

It is the first PR in series of PRs, which fix all problems.

Here I fixed only:
- iroha-cli
- libs
- ametsuchi
- consensus


### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

This PR does not change any logic, it introduces only small code refactorings.

Generally cppclean looks for unused includes, or suggests to place forward declarations. Both of these techniques reduce interdependency between objects, which is good -- it reduces recompilation of targets, if certain headers are changed.

Also, it found functions defined in cpp without keyword `static`. Without this keyword, functions have `external linkage` by default and are accessible by the rest of program just through forward declaration. I fixed also this.

### Possible Drawbacks 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

There are many issues with logger. Because logger is an alias to `spdlog::logger`, I need to write many lines to write forward declaration, which is bad. 
If we really need to fix these issues, I suggest to remove `logger::Logger` and use `std::unique_ptr<stdlog::logger>` everywhere. For now logger introduces many false positives.

To add a new Torii service:
- Add its description to proto file
- Inherit you service implementation class from iroha::protocol::<service_name>::Service and implement all methods you need by overriding grpc stubs
- Create your service class instance in application.cpp and add it to services collection, like
```torii_services.emplace_back(std::move(<your_service>));```
- Enjoy your service working

### Description of the Change

1. Adds test builders for transaction and query creation. 
2. Creates two new validators to query and transaction which always return empty answer with no errors (for test purposes)
3. Introduces new template parameter to query and transaction builder defining build type of the builder
4. Moves template tx and query builders into separate folders. Now transaction and query builders have only using definitions inside

### Benefits

Now we can build any transaction or query shared model objects using new builders, which has similar interfaces with the real builders

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

Unfortunately, we cannot use mocks to replace validators in tests because of drawback of google mock classes -- they cannot be copied. That prevents using them in builders, because every time we add new command to transaction we internally copy builder object, which is not possible when we use mock as stateless validator field.

This pull request modifies execute() method in command_executor, to return Result instead of bool. This means, that if for some reason, execution of the command has failed, a caller of the executor will know the reason why. This allows for better informativeness of error messages.
<!-- We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. -->
<!-- Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts. -->

### Benefits
1. Command executor now returns meaningful error message
2. Returned error contains command name

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 
1. Validate still returns bool, so it is impossible to know if the database has failed during validation.
2. Because database operations still return boolean, or optional, a lot of code needs to be added to transform it into the result, in the future, it will be simplified.
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*
Mutable storage and temporary wsv both output error message from command_executor into the log. This is the simplest use, and they can return a result as well, to tell components up in the chain what happened.

That's pr updates old model permission string names, so it may work with the shared_model as well.

### Possible Drawbacks 

?

### Alternate Designs

As an additional way of fixing that is converting permissions and leaving the old model as is. Imo that not really good because it requires update such strings in multiple places.

- [x] remove flat_file implementation
- [x] preserve flat_file.hpp interface in block_storage.hpp
- [x] make block_storage.hpp pure virtual class
- [x] split block_query_test onto two tests:  
       - unit test: uses mock for block  storage
       - integration test: uses NuDB underneath
- [x] implement block_storage.hpp interface with NuDB
- [x] remove `last_id` from block_storage.hpp, because logically it is invalid. Instead, add `total_keys` method.
- [x] update `hyperledger/iroha-docker-develop` to `v2` - it has new CMake (3.10.2), more boost libraries (thread, chrono, program_options), integrated NuDB
- [x] fix all tests, few minor bugs and miss spellings

### Benefits

- new cmake version in develop image
- new implementation of Block Storage with use of NuDB
- now Block Storage stores blocks properly, from index #0

### Possible Drawbacks 

- NuDB is bad option to store blocks and must be considered as short-term solution.
- BlockStorage interface must be reviewed and redesigned with use of cryptography (to have a possibility to implement light clients)
- BlockStorage now has no block validation logic. I.e., when you open database first time, you need to check that all stored blocks are really blocks, have valid signatures, and re-build WSV (or check its consistency, TBD)

### Description of the Change
Adds json converters from shared model objects with proto backend. 

### Benefits

Allows converting shared model objects into json and vice versa by means of protobuf methods.

### Possible Drawbacks 

* Currently conversions are done using functions without classes. Might look as a drawback for someone.

* While model to json function is straightforward, conversion from command contains 3 functions: 
1. jsonToModel -- general function to convert json into protobuf message objects. Returns none if json is not valid.
2. jsonToBlock -- function converting json into shared model block. Returns none if json is not valid.
3. jsonToTransaction -- function converting json into shared model transaction. Returns none if json is not valid.

* At the moment this PR was implemented proto class for proposal was not implemented. In future jsonToProposal function might be included.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

- Add separation of KeysManager's create/load methods that work with and without pass phrase
- Key is randomly generated

### Description of the Change
Based on https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/603, this pull request introduces Resutl<V, E> type which is either a result or an error. It can be used in error handling as a replacement for exceptions, where failure is expected, for example, validation, database access.

### Benefits

1. Allows providing information about error (one of the main drawbacks of optional)
2. More performant than exception handling and does not complicate control flow

### Possible Drawbacks 

1. Functional style match() call is used to retrieve a value, and any other option is no available. It disallows writing procedural style code.

### Description of the Change
#### Ansible
Ansible playbook was rewritten from scratch. There are now two separate roles for setting up Iroha cluster of arbitrary number of nodes, plus docker daemon installation routine.
A general role for user creation is also added.

#### Jenkins
Initial support for Jenkins pipeline introduced. All the steps except ""dockerize"" are reproduced.

The purpose of this documentation is to convey design and architecure aspects of Iroha ledger in a sctructured approach, as well as operational side: how-tos, guides, and examples. Docs are accessible via ReadTheDocs website, and can be generated to a lot of formats, available in Sphinx. In order to contribute, one should to be familiar with [reStructuredTest](docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) syntax, and follow principles described in this file.

### Benefits

Deleted legacy, created a structure for docs and example of docs, including launching Iroha on single node.

### Possible Drawbacks 

Requires constant updates of docs, and administering project in ReadTheDocs.

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

 * Python 2.7 installed
 * `pip install -r requirements.txt` in docs/source

Build steps

1. `cd docs/source`
1. `make html`

After that, the documentation is generated in html format in `_build` folder. You can check another formats on Sphinx website or just by typing `make`.

### P.S.
Please note change in ServerRunner destructor - it doesn't call shutdown for toriiServiceHandler anymore. The reason for that is possible double delete problem because ServerRunner::shutdown also also calls shutdown for toriiServiceHandler.

YAC relies on uniform peer order distribution for leaders selection, provided by getOrdering function.     
In this pr we implement pseudorandom ordering function which returns peer order uniformly distributed depending on the hash of the block.  

### Benefits

It is harder for adversary  to attack rotating leader committee. 

### Possible Drawbacks 

Current implementation relies on default random generation engine based on http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/linear_congruential_engine. 

<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

A toy test for a fairness of distribution is in this pr.  A simple statistic for distribution test can be considered in future, like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov–Smirnov_test 
<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*

It is interesting to implement for the future alternative order function with exponential distribution depending on various statistics, like availability time, probability of maliciousness etc. 
     
<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

This PR adds bash script `scripts/local-develop.sh`, which, when executed, creates two docker containers `<postgres, redis>` and outputs according environment variables. These can be safely used to execute your tests without docker environment.

Also I added +x permission for `scripts/build-test-swarm.sh`.

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->
Using this script bootstrapping of test/dev environment is easy.

This Pull Request introduces several changes to stateless validation:
1. FieldValidator now returns value of invalid field
2. Amount is checked to be greater than 0
3. CommandsValidator now appends counter to Command name, which allows understanding which command has failed.

The biggest change of this pull request is tests for FieldValidator, which are organized in a table-like manner with various test cases for different fields. Because of a lot of boilerplate, file is quite large, but it allows to add various test cases for different fields very easily.

### Benefits

1. Better error message for stateless validation
2. Test structure for FieldValidator allows us to test it easier

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

### Possible Drawbacks 

1. Size of the test file is quite large, and it may take some time to understand how it all works. 
<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->
<!-- If no drawbacks, explicitly mention this (write None) -->

### Usage Examples or Tests *[optional]*

<!-- Point reviewers to the test, code example or documentation which shows usage example of this feature -->
If you want to add a new constraint to some field, you can test it by adding a test case to appropriate map in file field_validator_test.cpp.

### Alternate Designs *[optional]*
Google Test has parametrized test which allows running a test with different values however it would complicate code even, and require even more boilerplate code.

Ed25519 library is statically linked.
   
## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
I've got a problem with new crypto library (I hope somebody else could also check it). Scenario is pretty simple:
1. Checkout actual develop branch.
2. Do clean.sh to ensure everything was cleaned.
3. Run cmake && make
This sequence gives me a stable problem when I try to run tests (or irohad, doesn't matter):
```
➜  build git:(develop) ctest
Test project /Users/konstantinmunichev/src/iroha/build
      Start  1: blob_converter_test
 1/77 Test  #1: blob_converter_test ....................   Passed    0.01 sec
      Start  2: block_insertion_test
 2/77 Test  #2: block_insertion_test ...................***Exception: Child aborted  0.01 sec
      Start  3: ametsuchi_test
 3/77 Test  #3: ametsuchi_test .........................***Exception: Child aborted  0.00 sec
.....
18% tests passed, 63 tests failed out of 77
```
The problem is ed25519 library (just an example):
```
➜  build git:(develop) test_bin/cache_test
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libed25519.1.2.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/konstantinmunichev/src/iroha/build/test_bin/cache_test
  Reason: image not found
```
The most interesting in this story is that rerunning build fixes the problem (e. g. touch CMakeLists.txt && make). Looks like shared lib wasn't created on the first passthrough but it actually did.

Looks like it should be fixed by setting rpath for this lib explicitly bit I tried and without success.",[],1,2017-12-23 23:42:19,2017-12-24 07:50:59,2018-03-28 04:04:33,True,2017-12-24 07:50:59,luckychess,unknown,,closed

There're issues with the swig string conversions, binary data is basically converted incorrectly

Fixes stateless validation
   
## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
This PR should fix stateless validation bug, which caused the following problem.

When we create CommandsValidator which validates tx, we invoke validate method, where we go through every command and call `boost::apply_visitor` using CommandsValidatorVisitor where for every possible command we have implemented operators to perform validation logic. Problem is that visitor wrongly deduces the command type which should be validated and invokes wrong operator. For example when we do `boost::apply_visitor` to AppendRole for some reason invokes RemoveSignatory operator, which is wrong.
The reason was found fixed: the order of commands in commands.proto should be the same as in variant template parameters
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
Please check commands_validator_test

## Details/Features
Fixed order of commands in commands.proto

Swig bindings for Python and Java. Scope is shared model builders and signing built objects.
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
Bindings libraries are disabled by default. To generate them add ```-DSWIG_PYTHON=ON``` and/or ```-DSWIG_JAVA=ON``` option to your cmake command.
Then you can build Iroha as usual. After the build process is completed navigate to ```build/shared_model//bindings/```. You can use Iroha crypto from Python in a next way:
```
import iroha

builder = iroha.ModelBuilder()
crypto = iroha.ModelCrypto()

me_kp = crypto.generateKeypair()
peer_kp = crypto.generateKeypair()
signatory_kp = crypto.generateKeypair()
account_kp = crypto.generateKeypair()
time = 1512549580
startCounter = 1
creator = ""me""
signatory = ""fyodorkek-san""

commands = []

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time).addPeer(""127.0.0.1:50051"", peer_kp.publicKey()).build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+1).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+1).createDomain(""iroha"", ""admin"").build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+2).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+2).createAccount(""luckychess"", ""iroha"", account_kp.publicKey()).build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+3).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+3).addSignatory(signatory, signatory_kp.publicKey()).build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+4).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+4).removeSignatory(signatory, signatory_kp.publicKey()).build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+5).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+5).setAccountQuorum(signatory, 2).build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+6).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+6).assetQuantity(""luckychess@iroha"", ""irohacoin#iroha"", ""123.45"").build())

commands.append(builder.txCounter(startCounter+7).creatorAccountId(creator).createdTime(time+7).transferAsset(""luckychess@iroha"", ""kamil@iroha"", ""irohacoin#iroha"", ""hello world"", ""12.45"").build())


protoHelper = iroha.ModelTransactionProto()

for command in commands:
    print(protoHelper.signAndAddSignature(command, me_kp).toString())
```
And from Java:
```

and then run
```

```
Also please note that shared object library for Python (_iroha.so) is different from Java library (libiroha.so) even though they provide exactly the same functionality.

**Note about Java:** if you run your Java code you've just built you will probably give the ```java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError``` exception. The reason is because Java runtime can't find native .so library (libiroha.so in our case). Just use the next command:
```

Bindings of Iroha crypto for Python and Java
   
## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
Iroha uses custom signature algorithm (ed25519 with sha-3 inside) so we need support it for different languages. Bindings are the easiest way.
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
Bindings libraries are disabled by default. To generate them add ```-DSWIG=ON``` option to your cmake command, e. g. (if you are in build/ directory):
```cmake -DSWIG=ON ..```
Now you can build Iroha as usual. After the build process is completed navigate to ```build/shared_model/cryptography/ed25519_sha3_impl/bindings/```. You can use Iroha crypto from Python in a next way:
```
import irohacrypto
blob1 = irohacrypto.Blob(""1"")
blob2 = irohacrypto.Blob(""2"")
prov = irohacrypto.CryptoProvider()
keypair = prov.generateKeypair()
sig = prov.sign(blob1, keypair)
print(prov.verify(sig, blob1, keypair.publicKey()))
print(prov.verify(sig, blob2, keypair.publicKey()))
```
And from Java:
```
public class my {
  static {
    try {
        System.loadLibrary(""irohacrypto"");
    } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
      System.err.println(""Native code library failed to load. \n"" + e);
      System.exit(1);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String argv[]) {
    Blob blob1 = new Blob(""1"");
    Blob blob2 = new Blob(""2"");
    CryptoProvider prov = new CryptoProvider();
    Keypair keypair = prov.generateKeypair();
    Signed sig = prov.sign(blob1, keypair);
    System.out.println(prov.verify(sig, blob1, keypair.publicKey()));
    System.out.println(prov.verify(sig, blob2, keypair.publicKey()));
  }
}
```
and then run
```
javac *.java
```
If everything has gone well you will receive the next result:
```
true
false
```
Also please note that shared object library for Python (_irohacrypto.so) is different from Java library (libirohacrypto.so) even though they provide exactly the same functionality.

**Note about Java:** if you run your Java code you've just built you will probably give the ```java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError``` exception. The reason is because Java runtime can't find native .so library (libirohacrypto.so in our case). Just use the next command:
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. java my
```
where **my** is a name of your manually created file.

- Most of the types was moved out from mst_types to model ones
- Mst is fixed for using it's own type `DataType`, that basically an alias for `std::shared_ptr<iroha::model::Transaction>`
- In mst state is made an explicit copy of tx
- [tx_processor](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/690/commits/c52c95cb42ecdd04e3f5bd3cd359e2f4aa8942b7#diff-2555aa1c75c15355ee489fce2274d681) code was shortened of boost (`join`, `for_each`, `adaptor::filtered`)

Fix issue with duplicated txs return from GetAccountTransactions

## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?

In case of, there are two same user's transactions in a same block, GetAccountTransactions returns twice transactions.
In case of, there are three same user's transactions in a same block, GetAccountTransactions returns three times transactions.

For example:

If there are two same user's transactions, `getBlockIds( lrange username 0 -1 )` returns two same block ids.
ex.)
> 1) ""1""
> 2) ""1""

Thus, the number of transactions are 4.

If there are three same user's transactions, `getBlockIds( lrange username 0 -1 )` returns two same block ids.
ex.)
> 1) ""1""
> 2) ""1""
> 3) ""1""

Thus, the number of transactions are 9.

I expected to be returned only one transaction. 

So I changed `std::vector<uint64_t> block_ids` in getBlockIds to `std::set<uint64_t> block_ids` to remove duplicated block ids.

Deb package has its own internal dependencies (like `libboost-system-dev`, etc) which should be installed manually using `apt`.

However, `libgrpc`, `libprotobuf` and `libgrpc++` can not be installed through apt, and I decided to package them together with binaries.

Currently, anything can be packaged (directory, file, library, binary, whatever) just by adding according `install` step, thanks to CPack.

Changelog:
- [x] tar.gz package
- [x] deb package
- [ ] MAC package (current version has some bundle code, but it is not tested by myself)
- [x] rpm bundle (untested)
- [x] ed25519 is now static lib
- [x] if some dependency is not installed, cmake now pretty prints what exactly is required with link to github and commit id.
- [x] added RPATH to this folders: `.` , `lib`, `../lib`. It means, that libraries can be in any of these directories.

Just type “make"" you can  build and run Hyperledger Iroha, and stop it, also execution of test, and run sample programs.

Specifically, it executes as follows. Run make using the git cloned Makefile in Hyperledger Iroha's directory. Internally, the following four steps are executed.

· Bulding of iroha-docker-develop container for development
· Building Hyperledger Iroha using by iroha-docker-develop container
· Extract binaries, libraries for execution from the built hyperledger Iroha
· Building a Hyperledger Iroha container for execution from the extracted binary, library

You can also start up with ""make up"", stop it with ""make down"". By running ""make test"" with Hyperledger Iroha running, you can running the test program in test_bin directory.

You can also execute sample programs which using iroha-cli by executing ""make up"" in the example directory, running Hyperledger Iroha, and typing ""make hakodate"". In this case, you can refer to the execution log with ""make log"".

In either case, if you want to stop Hyperledger Iroha do ""make down"".

Especially when using Raspberry Pi, swap is used about 3 GB at build time. Therefore, it is better to prepare 4 gigabytes or more of swap using external storage.

## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
Allows simpler deployment of docker instances by setting environment variables with `-e` instead of modifying docker image or creating a volume.
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
Set environment variables before running `irohad`.
Example:
```
IROHA_BLOCK_STORE_PATH=$(pwd)/block_store IROHA_TORII_PORT=50051 IROHA_PG_HOST=localhost IROHA_PG_PORT=5432 IROHA_PG_USER=postgres IROHA_PG_PASS=mysecretpassword IROHA_REDIS_HOST=localhost IROHA_REDIS_PORT=6379 IROHA_PEER_NUMBER=0 ./cmake-build-debug/bin/irohad --genesis_block ./docs/zero.block
```

## Details/Features
- `IROHA_BLOCK_STORE_PATH` - path to block store
- `IROHA_TORII_PORT` - port for client interaction
- `IROHA_PG_HOST`, `IROHA_PG_PORT`, `IROHA_PG_USER`, `IROHA_PG_PASS` - PostgreSQL connection details

Changes related to crypto:
- hash provider removed from everywhere
- crypto reworked (hashes and signatures)
- everything uses crypto were changed accordingly
- changed model for proto - transaction and query: both of them now have a payload field contained all the data and signature field for a payload's signature
- all code is changed according to new model (serializers, deserializers, converters and some other)

Other changes:
- cmake proto compilation improvements
- queries in serializers are const now
- std::abs compilation issue (again!)
   
## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
Now to use crypto functions you have to serialize your model object to proto object and use its string representation (see code example below). This way allows us to get consistent hashes/signatures which do not depend from target platform internal binary data representation (endianess and so on). Proto model changes simplify crypto usage: now you always have a payload field and hashes/signs are calculated from it.
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
Typical workflow for hashing and signing now:
```
protocol::Transaction tx;
hash256_t hash = sha3_256(tx.payload().SerializeAsString());
iroha::sign(hash.to_string(), pubkey, privkey);
```

To get a signature from string there is from_string function available:
```
Signature sign{};
sign.pubkey = pubkey_t::from_string(pubkey_string);
sign.signature = sig_t::from_string(signature_string);
```

- Absence of effective realization of crypto provider
- Only normal case is provided
- Implementation doesn't use modern concurrency techniques for working

Architecture issues:
- _YacGate_ is implementation of _ConsensusGate_.
- Yac by its nature doesn't operate with block objects. Consensus operate wtih hash values, thus, commit and vote made in terms of hashes. Yac interface for it called _HashGate_.
- The algorithm of consensus provided in yac.hpp. Algorithm manage internal storage and network for concluding own decisions. 
- The network is provided in yac_network_interface.hpp. Current network implementation is grpc.
- Ordering of current consensus round is provided in cluster_order.hpp.
- PeerOrderer interface is responsible for retrieving information about peers and creating order on it for each round. This module similar to peer service, but in current Yac we don't use trust system, therefore, the module requires only peers stored in the ledger.
- Yac_crypto_provider.hpp presents cryptography for business objects: votes, commits, rejects.

## P.S.
How to review? I think good strategy get acquainted with all interfaces and business objects in irohad/consensus/yac/ folder. Next, go to the algorithm itself in impl/yac.cpp, after look for tests in _yac_sunny_day_test.cpp_ file. Similarly with all other dependencies.

## P.P.S.
Whole transaction pipeline for Yac depends on ordering service. Current implementation of OS presented in #476.  But good point is implementation totally independent from it.",[],89,2017-07-31 18:19:12,2017-08-01 17:39:08,2017-08-02 20:50:32,True,2017-08-01 17:39:08,muratovv,unknown,,closed

Each command has two methods: validate and execute. 
Validate method checks permissions and business. Execute is coupled with database commands allowing to perform checks for existence in database.

iroha,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha/pulls/451,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/451,Warchant,[Ready] Peer service,"## What is this pull request?
This is simple implementation of asynchronous peer service.
   
## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
It is able to answer the following questions:
- what peers are currently online
- what is their state (state is `<merkle root, height>`)
- what is the latest state among all peers

It DOES NOT answer the questions:
- who is the leader
- what is the current order
- who is the proxy tail
These are consensus-specific things and will be implemented in consensus module. From peer service we need only availability and peer's state.
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
There is an example in:
`iroha/test/module/irohad/peerservice/peerservice_peer`

1. go to build directory
2. `cmake ..`
3. `make peerservice_peer`
4. `cd test_bin`
5. ```
    peerservice_peer 4 0
    peerservice_peer 4 1
    peerservice_peer 4 2
    peerservice_peer 4 3

*Peer service is an implementation of GRPC server, it MUST be registered in grpc::ServerBuilder*.

Async Torii service implementation.

## How to use the features provided in the pull request?
### Example
If we want to deal multiple rpc in a service, we can do such as follows:
```proto
service Service {
  rpc SendTx(Tx) returns TxResponse
  rpc SendQuery(Query) returns QueryResponse
}
```
```cpp
class ServiceHandler : public GrpcAsyncService {
public:
  void handleRpcs() {
    // Spawn a new request state manager.
    enqueueRequest<Tx, TxResponse>(
      &Service::AsyncService::RequestSendTx, // specify auto created request method
      &ServiceHandler::SendTxHandler              // handler function
    );
    enqueueRequest<Query, QueryResponse>(
      &Service::AsyncService::RequestSendQuery,
      &ServiceHandler::SendQueryHandler
    );
    ...
  }

public:
  template <class RequestType, class ResponseType>
  using ServiceCall = Call<ServiceHandler, Service::AsyncService, RequestType, ResponseType>;

private:
  void SendTxHandler(ServiceCall<Tx, TxResponse>* call) {
    // Inject request and response from call object
    auto request = call->request();
    auto& response = call->response();

    Service::SendTx(request, &response);  // call actual `SendTx()` If we extract this function to outside, we can deal async rpc easily like sync serives.

    enqueueRequest<Tx, TxResponse>(...);  // Re-spawn a new request state manager. Current one will be auto deleted.
  }

  void SendQueryHandler(ServiceCall<Query, QueryResponse>* call) {
    ...
    enqueueRequest<Query, QueryResponse>(...);
  }
}
```

- One `Call` instance manages one async rpc call. It manages rpc state and executes actual procedures.

- Add client.cpp and connection test to ordering/.
- Add first part of following commit: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/390

## P.S. 
- How to use gRPC async doc is working at:
https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/wiki/display/IS/Comparison+between+synchronous+and+asynchronous+gRPC+implementations
  - This doc may clarify what is the best implementation of async gRPC.

- Proposal of client interface is working at:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/391
  - This interface is not included yet. We will replace the code if the PR is approved. (I think this PR helps for easy creating connection mocks)

- Later, I'll also merge this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/386",[],16,2017-06-26 00:12:06,2017-06-27 13:55:08,2017-06-28 08:32:12,False,,,unknown,,closed

Promote to use more strict type array definition.
1. type.hpp: type definition which size is strictly defined (mainly for crypto).
2. Microsoft/GSL: it allows to use `array_view`, `span`

## Why do you implement it? Why do we need this pull request?
  
## How to use the features provided in the pull request?

## Details/Features
### type.hpp
- `blob_t<N>`: blob type that can be convertible to base64 or hex string
- `ed25519::sig_t`, `ed25519::pubkey_t`, `ed25519::privkey_t`
  - type aliases that have strict sizes.
- `ed25519::keypair_t`: pair of `pubkey_t` and `privkey_t`

### Microsoft/GSL
- For `array_view`, `span`
- (Please add comment here)

tiny - is a minimal docker image, which includes **only** iroha binaries compiled in Release mode, config files and libraries.
It can be built by calling `docker/build.sh` in one minute.

As a consequence, we do not create isolated environment to build iroha image (iroha-dev), so *to build tiny you should be able to build iroha in your OS*.

But this environment was saved as `warchantua/iroha-dev` and used in circle 2.0 to speed-up the build process.

### Config-discovery was removed

It means, that you **can not** create a network with docker-compose (it was also removed). 

BUT, with use of peer service, I can write new docker-compose file, which will be able to:
 - create arbitrary number of nodes connected in a network
 - deploy this stack on a docker swarm in one command

(docker dev team has released docker-compose v3.0 and this is possible now!)

### Circle 2.0

Now circle 2.0 builds and pushes to docker hub successful builds from *any branch*.
To access your image:
```
docker pull hyperledger/iroha-docker:branch_name
```

And then use. 
List of all releases is on docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/iroha-docker/tags/

    - Each objects (Account, Asset and so on) are constructed as JSON like structures, so exchanging data by using hash map is heavy work. I think exchanging data by using JSON string is better.

- Use fPIC compile options because shared library is used for Java to use Iroha native code.
