My app, currently integrated with Bighchaindb blockchain, uses the blockchain as storage for AP location information and user location history and mobility profiles. 

The data I store is in maps/lists (asset payload). The size of each asset payload is in the range of 5-10 KB.

Would I be able to use the iroha blockchain in the same way?

One last question. Does the iroha-android application need to be updated to work?

Thanks,

Alex

Key can be 64 bytes and value is 4 KB at max. Ask Iroha team if you need more, they will likely implement custom constraints.

I do not know about iroha-android, but if it does not work for you -- maybe it is broken :-)

I will need more than 4kb per asset. But, that's OK. To start with I can certainly work with 4kb.

I was wondering if I could get some advise...apologise if this is the wrong forum for that. But would the sdk (and the other SDKs) allow the downloading client to join a network as a node that validates transactions? Or does this enable the sending of transactions, and querying of a ledger? 

The general use case I am considering is this: I want to build an app that will allow clients to participate as peers in a network..so the app would need to be installed natively as opposed to using the docker pardigm for hyperledger fabric.
