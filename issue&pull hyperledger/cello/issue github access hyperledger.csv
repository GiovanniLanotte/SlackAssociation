This part makes kube network not working properly, when developers set the domain value as they like.

cello,jordandearsley,https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/pull/6,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/cello/issues/6,Added ability to redeploy bna archive on existing fabric network via ansible play,"There was originally no way to redeploy a bna on an existing network through the command line without reconfiguring the entire network which I thought was a bit overkill. Trying to follow the name format, I created upgradecomposer.yml which runs the plays.yml in roles/upgrade_compose. Inside upgrade_compose I added the apply.yml, making use of `composer network install` and `composer network upgrade`, I added two plays using those two commands.

After exporting NETWORKNAME and project_version as environment variables, running this line should do the trick, given the bna in secrets/network has been replaced with the newest version, and it's under the same filename.

`ansible-playbook -i run/runhosts -e ""mode=apply env=bc1st NETWORKNAME=empty-business-network project_version=0.0.2-deploy.36"" upgradecomposer.yml`

This is my first time contributing to an open source project, so feel free to suggest changes.",closed,True,2018-05-24 19:29:59,2018-05-25 14:17:28
