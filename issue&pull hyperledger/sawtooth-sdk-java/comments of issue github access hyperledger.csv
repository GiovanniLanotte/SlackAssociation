   I would like to suggest bumping the Java version to 11, due to this points:
- Java 8 has many [issues](https://blog.docker.com/2018/04/improved-docker-container-integration-with-java-10/) on virtualization, corrected in java 10.
- Java 8 will start the [EOL cycle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html) next year.
- Java 10/11 are VERY optimized for streams and multithread applications. (and I strongly advocate the use of reactive programming.)
- The changes I've submitted where created using Java 10, so, there's no compatibility issue.
- But, Java 10 it's [already EOLed](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html).

scenario (server and client) are slightly different, like I commented above.
