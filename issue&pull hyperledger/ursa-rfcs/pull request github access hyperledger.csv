ursa-rfcs,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pulls/4,https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pull/4,dhuseby,"adding RFC version, alternate layout suggestion, slight reformatting","My suggestions from the template discussion didn't get landed/considered. I am submitting them here so we can discuss.

The first change is adding a version to the header and a changelog to the footer of an RFC. If RFCs will get updated in subsequect PRs as things evolve, I think we should track that evolution explicitly in the RFC.

The second change is suggesting that instead of having the RFCs in a ""text"" subfolder that we just keep them in the root. Then I also added the suggestion of having subfolders for supporting files such as images or diagrams. The subfolder will be named the same as the RFC document.",[],2,2019-01-10 23:55:19,2019-02-20 15:17:30,2019-02-20 15:17:31,True,2019-02-20 15:17:30,mikelodder7,unknown,,closed
