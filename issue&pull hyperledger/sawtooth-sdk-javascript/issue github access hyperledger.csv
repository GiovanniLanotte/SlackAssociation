sawtooth-sdk-javascript,delventhalz,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-javascript/pull/2,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-javascript/issues/2,Add SDK files from core repo,"This PR pulls the Javascript SDK files from the core repo , adding them here. This will simplify build processes and the development workflow. In addition to pulling the original files and commits, a number of additional commits rearrange/rename the files and incorporate integration tests.

Note that this is a very large PR with thousands of commits, only the last fifteen of which are original. It is probably simpler to review the [source branch](https://github.com/Cargill/sawtooth-sdk-javascript/tree/c001-add-core-js-sdk) as a final product, then to go commit by commit here.

The sister PR to this one is [Remove JS SDK files from core repo](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1730) on `hyperledger/sawtooth-core`.
