1. Node IDs despite being public key addresses are treated as strings and are expected to be lower case
2. The tcp:// never used to be included, but when it is it must be before the ID

So:

You have:
```
  PersistentPeers = ""D6018980487BFE80E77AAD6B85F84E3248EF1C8A@tcp://0.0.0.0:20000""
```
You need:
```
  PersistentPeers = ""tcp://d6018980487bfe80e77aad6b85f84e3248ef1c8a@0.0.0.0:20000""
```

That crazy one-liner now gets's the tcp:// in the wrong place - though it does have the downcase function so not sure how you ended up with the upper case ID.

Let me know how you get on. I'm sure the docs/process could be improved here - and if you are willing to give that a go contributions are very welcome.",2019-03-06 20:31:08,2019-03-06 20:32:20

Your solution perfectly worked. I am getting node id using below command line and manually putting into .burrow_val1.toml file:

cp: /Users/villemossip/go/bin/burrow: No such file or directory
make: *** [install_burrow] Error 1

I figured out another approach to fix this issue. This is what i did:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin/burrow
export GOPATH=$HOME/go 
cd $HOME/go && mkdir bin && cd bin && mkdir burrow
cd $HOME/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow
make install_burrow
```
Now it doesn't return `No such file or directory` error
```
➜  burrow git:(develop) ✗ make install_burrow
go build -ldflags ""-extldflags '-static' \
	-X github.com/hyperledger/burrow/project.commit=v0.23.3-152-ge3c0d46a \

cp /Users/villemossip/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/bin/burrow /Users/villemossip/go/bin/burrow
```

Now I am able to successfully execute command `burrow spec -p1 -f1 | burrow configure -s- > burrow.toml` and start the node with `burrow start --validator-index=0`.

I hope this will be useful for someone in the future. Spent too much time figuring out the issue.

I am now fairly convinced that failure to decode an event ought to be catastrophic (at least for the projection - table spec - involved) since this fundamentally breaks synchronisation with the chain. The reasoning is as follows:

If we err on an event decode then either we will a) fail on every subsequent event or b) succeed on some future event.

In the case a) then the table that is receiver for the event will stay stuck in the past. This kills our liveness but doesn't violate safety. Consumers can look at the offset and detect they are getting stale results (within some bounds).

In case b) we now have completely undefined behaviour, for example, suppose the true execution is:
```
height      action
1           CREATE_USER Annie
33          GRANT_DEATHSTAR_PERMISSIONS Annie
45          REVOKE_DEATHSTAR_PERMISSIONS Annie
55          GRANT_CATAPULT_PERMISSIONS Annie
60          ENABLE_WEAPONS Annie
70          FIRE_WEAPONS Annie
```

But the application sees:
```
height      action
1           CREATE_USER Annie
33          GRANT_DEATHSTAR_PERMISSIONS Annie
55          GRANT_CATAPULT_PERMISSIONS Annie
60          ENABLE_WEAPONS Annie
70          FIRE_WEAPONS Annie
```

Clearly the result is very different, but the application (particularly in the presence of the burrow.js/vent sync feature) believes it is caught up and is seeing valid state. 

Note that case b) is entirely possible - since ABI decoding may fail with some but nor all events (e.g. it may succeed with an old spec that just omits a new field but now one that includes it). If it does fail with all future events, then not much point in running vent against that table spec anymore until it gets fixed.

Where I can see the case for having vent carrying on is carrying on processing other table specs when one fails, i.e. to not have the entire process bail on a bad decode. However whether this leads to global inconsistency in the database entirely depends on the logical dependencies between tables so this should at most be an option.

I feel the pain of the ABI wrangling - but I'm not sure this is a good place to try and solve it. ",2019-02-06 13:25:52,2019-02-06 13:27:13

The time is purely from Tendermint. Looking at the code this seems to me like it is probably an 'as designed' thing. Their implementation of 'BFT time' makes use of time stamps in that are included in commits. Commits are the subject of BFT agreement and contain a time. When `CreateEmptyBlocks` is disabled then the tendermint state machine does not propose blocks in the absence of transactions and there will be no commits apart from the last committed block with transactions.

So when you see the timestamp of the previous block + 1 (I think the +1 is just related to how the median is calculated - do you have 1 validator) that is what BFT time provides - commits are not available for the _current_ block when it is proposed so the time is based on the previous block - this is common in tendermint where state hashes and so on run one block behind.

It's difficult to know how they could do better - they need a round of consensus to get determine the BFT time, but if they do a round of consensus they need to store the commits (basically the block).

Times be hard.

Just to pull in what I mentioned on rocket chat: 

If you change `Enabled = true` in the burrow.toml in:

```
  [RPC.Profiler]
    Enabled = false
    ListenAddress = ""tcp://127.0.0.1:6060""

```
then if you have Go installed once the memory is ramped up a bit run
`go tool pprof -top http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap`

Because this time, I wasn't so much interested in whether the burrow processes would run without crashing for a long amount of time, I just wanted to reproduce the memory usage problem. So this time:

- Every 20 seconds, a batch of 50 contracts was deployed
- Every 10 seconds, 1 contract was deployed and 100 transactions were made to this contract (a setter function was called, which also emitted an event)
- Every 2 seconds, the CPU and memory usage of one of the burrow processes were logged as CSV data
- Every 10 seconds, the total size of the blockchain directory of one of the burrow processes was calculated and logged as CSV data
- Empty blocks (burrow setting) **disabled**

Again it was a setup with 2 validator burrow processes on the same machine: let's call them A and B. A was added as a persistent peer to B. So A was started first. This time only process B had very high memory usage, A seemed more stable at around 90 MB. (I don't know if during the original experiment, the memory usage was high for both processes or only for process B). All transactions were sent to the GRPC of process B.

The following is a graph showing CPU and memory usage of B:

![cpu memory usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37209254/49517308-27231f80-f89c-11e8-95f9-19bdca569f57.png)

As you can see, no more deployment transactions would 'complete' (from burrow.js perspective) after CPU usage of B hit 100% and memory usage was past 1 GB. So something went wrong there (too high load?). The application however kept sending deployment transactions all the way to the end, which could explain the further increase in memory usage.

Process B was configured to expose the memory profiler, here's the output all the way at the end:
[pprof-output.txt](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/files/2648957/pprof-output.txt)

I have a hunch that it might be due to event subscriptions building up under load (we use event subscriptions to return the `TxExecution` during the `BroadcastTxSync`.

However, the fact we are query parsing at all is unnecessary and I have optimised this on develop with #974. @seanyoung is going to take a more careful look and reproduce what you are seeing - but if you have any time in the meantime could you have a go with latest develop and see if you see the issue.

One thing we have observed is the go runtime tends to be reserving quite a bit more memory than that which is shown on pprof heap. Some of this is likely to be down to caching, but not all.

You did three experiments:

1. Long-running, low load (deploys every 10 minutes)
2. Short-running, highest load (deploys every 20 seconds)
3. Short-running, medium load (deploys every 40 seconds)

Experiment 1 is the one I would most like to see the pprof output from - I wonder if you would be able to re-run it to see if the same behaviour occurs? The load is so low - much lower than we have test chains for I think that it i surprising to see this memory use

In 2 I believe the load saturated the CPU which caused subscriptions in our event system to mount up. This manifest as a very large allocation to Query (held here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/event/pubsub/pubsub.go#L62) but under CPU saturation I believe the reason for it is failure to unsubscribe listeners, which is possilbe if the context on an unsubsribe times out or otherwise completes: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/event/pubsub/pubsub.go#L132 (note we handle the unsubscribe in a defer statement - https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/transactor.go#L90 though we do use the background context - so not entirely clear what this would lead to.

In any case I am fairly confident that the CPU saturation will be mostly down to logging, i.e. I notice you have set `ExcludeTrace = false` (which makes sense for debug I agree!) but this generates a large amount of logging and also by default does a certain amount of post-processing on the log output to give it nice formatting. Really their ought to be a health-warning on`ExcludeTrace = false` - for production or performance testing this should be disabled. In experiment 2 you are still only doing 12.5 transactions per second. In my rather more adhoc testing (and in integration tests) I have seen Burrow comfortably handle 600+ tps with non-trivial contracts. Admittedly that tends to be more bursty. I think trace logging gets pretty ridiculous under high transaction load.

In experiment 3 we see heap allocation that is pretty much as expected. The system memory does grow - and this is something I have seen locally too - that system memory allocation is a significant multiple of heap allocation. There are a few possible reasons:

- We are leaking non-heap memory (i.e. stack) which will be a bit harder to debug (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15848) 

- The Go runtime is hanging on to a lot of system memory that is has internally released to optimise its own allocations (it's not inconceivable Go is behaving badly in respect of some heuristic is uses for releasing memory - this is rather old so probably no longer applies but something like it might: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16516189/why-total-mb-in-golang-heap-profile-is-less-than-res-in-top)

- Memory is just not getting GC'd quickly enough 

It will be interesting to see a) what happens with `ExcludeTrace = true` and b) whether heap allocation tracks system allocation if we add some `debug.FreeOSMemory()` calls around the place.

There's probably a few other ways we could be a bit more graceful about what happens with event subscriptions under CPU saturation too.",2018-12-07 10:49:46,2018-12-07 10:53:26

One meta question for now though is whether we should try and merge BIPs as 'fully formed', which wouldn't mean they could not longer be changed, or whether we should just merge based on whether the spirit of the thing is basically a good idea.

I can see advantages of both, on the one hand it seems like a lot of effort for the PRer to have to go through and make everyone else's edits so merging it would open up for subsequent tweaks as PRs. Then again I wouldn't want a half-finished or ill-conceived BIP to attract legitimacy just because it was in the repo if it ends up getting slightly abandoned.

A middle ground might be to merge proposed BIPs into their own branch - merging in them into master when they seem reasonably complete. We could use a special branch for this, or we could use develop.

I think it might be better to ensure that the global permissions account is always defined. I presume difficulty is you may need hack on your account/address model to get the zero address defined?

go-hex was introduced in large part because it has an an `EncodeUpper` function that gives you upper case hex - which we sort of need for consistency across go-amino and other endpoitns. That combined with an order of magnitude speedup seemed like a good enough reason to use the library. However, this is an unintended consequence, and now we use protobuf we are spending less time than we used to doing hex encoding. I would consider going back to stdlib - I'm not sure how many people this issue effects.

- Left aligned colourised output of key value in square brackets
- Key-values aligned
- Possibly a default sort order over keys (which we could add to) see sort_logger
- Striped colouring of keys/values
- Generated colours for the same key (by doing a quick hash)
- A custom log format (we have template support) for burrow deploy specifically

- We can introduce an registration interface `Register(codeHash []byte, abi *abi.AbiSpec)` this could be implemented against existing namereg but we may want to consider if it ought to be its own storage.

- We should replace `Account.Code` with `Account.CodeHash` and start storing code separately. This has two advantages: it de-duplicates code storage, and it gives us a pre-computed code hash with which we can `Lookup(codeHash []byte) *abi.AbiSpec`.

- If we provide the option to provide code hash to abi mappings with burrow deploy (in CallTx) then we will register ABI's on a best effort basis. It is perfectly legal to have contracts with no ABI (e.g. assembly generated). We also anticipate some corner cases where code hashes do not match so we should ideally have a weak assumption of ABI availability.

- This method should work for contracts generated by factory contracts (since we just look up by code hash). For these contracts when we compile (via deploy) we will need to build the mapping from binary files corresponding to individual contracts to those contracts ABIs. We do this by hashing the bytecode for each contract. The solidity compiler can be made to generate separate binary files and ABIs for each included file so at compile time we can collate this information. Without this mapping we would not be able to reassociate ABIs with autonomously created contracts.

- We may need to normalise metadata at the end of solidity generated bytecode in order to get reliable hash collisions for the 'same code'.",2018-11-20 12:07:25,2018-11-20 12:09:01

please find below all steps I followed, hope you will reproduce easily.

### Install latest burrow from source

```bash
# be sure to be on latest burrow
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/hyperledger
cd $GOPATH/src/hyperledger
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow.git
cd burrow
git checkout develop
go install github.com/hyperledger/burrow/cmd/burrow
(burrow --version | grep 0.22.0) || echo ""not latest""
```

### Configure chain
```bash
 rm -rf .burrow* .keys*
 burrow spec -f2 | burrow configure -s- > .burrow_init.toml
```

### Generate one additional key in another local store for seed node
```bash
 burrow spec -f1 | burrow configure --keysdir=.keys_seed -s- > /dev/null
```

### Make 2 validator nodes and one seed node config files
From the generated `.burrow_init.toml `file, create new files for each node, and change the content, example:

#### Seed node `.burrow_seed.toml` modified line from `.burrow_init.toml`
```toml
[Tendermint]
  SeedMode = true
  ListenAddress = ""tcp://0.0.0.0:10000""
  Moniker = ""seed_node_0""
  TendermintRoot = "".burrow_seed_0""

[Execution]

[Keys]
  GRPCServiceEnabled = false
  AllowBadFilePermissions = true
  RemoteAddress = """"
  KeysDirectory = "".keys_seed""

[RPC]
  [RPC.Info]
    Enabled = true
    ListenAddress = ""tcp://127.0.0.1:10001""
  [RPC.Profiler]
    Enabled = false
  [RPC.GRPC]
    Enabled = false
  [RPC.Metrics]
    Enabled = false
```

#### Validator 1 node `.burrow_val0.toml` modified line from `.burrow_init.toml`

```toml
[Tendermint]
  Seeds = ""PUT_HERE_SEED_NODE_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS""
  SeedMode = false
  PersistentPeers = """"
  ListenAddress = ""tcp://0.0.0.0:20000""
  Moniker = ""val_node_0""
  TendermintRoot = "".burrow_node0""

[Execution]

[Keys]
  GRPCServiceEnabled = false
  AllowBadFilePermissions = true
  RemoteAddress = """"
  KeysDirectory = "".keys""

[RPC]
  [RPC.Info]
    Enabled = true
    ListenAddress = ""tcp://127.0.0.1:20001""
  [RPC.Profiler]
    Enabled = false
  [RPC.GRPC]
    Enabled = true
    ListenAddress = ""127.0.0.1:20002""
  [RPC.Metrics]
    Enabled = false
```

#### Validator 2 node `.burrow_val1.toml` modified line from `.burrow_init.toml`

```toml
[Tendermint]
  Seeds = ""PUT_HERE_SEED_NODE_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS""
  SeedMode = false
  PersistentPeers = """"
  ListenAddress = ""tcp://0.0.0.0:30000""
  Moniker = ""val_node_1""
  TendermintRoot = "".burrow_node1""

[Execution]

[Keys]
  GRPCServiceEnabled = false
  AllowBadFilePermissions = true
  RemoteAddress = """"
  KeysDirectory = "".keys""

[RPC]
  [RPC.Info]
    Enabled = true
    ListenAddress = ""tcp://127.0.0.1:30001""
  [RPC.Profiler]
    Enabled = false
  [RPC.GRPC]
    Enabled = true
    ListenAddress = ""127.0.0.1:30002""
  [RPC.Metrics]
    Enabled = false
```

#### Start the seed node
```bash
burrow start --validator-address=`basename .keys_seed/data/* .json` --config=.burrow_seed.toml
```

#### Find seed node external address
Tendermint requires strict and routable address (not loopback, local etc), you can find the listen address with this command:
```bash
SEED_URL=`curl -s 127.0.0.1:10001/network | jq -r '.result.ThisNode | [.ID, .ListenAddress] | join(""@"") | ascii_downcase'`
sed -i s%PUT_HERE_SEED_NODE_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS%${SEED_URL}% .burrow_val0.toml
sed -i s%PUT_HERE_SEED_NODE_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS%${SEED_URL}% .burrow_val1.toml
```

#### Start validator nodes
```bash
burrow start --validator-index=0 --config=.burrow_val0.toml
burrow start --validator-index=1 --config=.burrow_val1.toml
```

#### Disable Tendermint strict address if required
If you face _Cannot add non-routable address_ message in logs, it means your listen address is not routable for tendermint.
You can disable this check by modified default tendermint/config.go:46
```go
conf.P2P.AddrBookStrict = false
```

### Send transactions

#### Create a deploy file _test.yaml_
```yaml
jobs:
- name: sendTxTest1
  send:
      destination: PUT_HERE_ONE_ACCOUNT_OF_YOUR_GENESIS
      amount: 42
```

#### Send it from a node
```bash
SIGNING_ADDRESS=HERE_ONE_ADDRESS_OF_THE_GENESIS
burrow deploy --address $SIGNING_ADDRESS -f test.yaml -u 127.0.0.1:20002
```
It outputs:
```
*****Executing Job*****

Job Name                                    => defaultAddr

### Do it with persistent peers
if you face issue with seed node mode sync (as me), you can easily connect 2 validator nodes directly by setting persistent peers.

```toml
[Tendermint]
  Seeds = """"
  SeedMode = false
  PersistentPeers = ""PUT_HERE_NODE_0_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS""
  ListenAddress = ""tcp://0.0.0.0:30000""
  Moniker = ""val_node_1""
  TendermintRoot = "".burrow_node1""
```

```bash
NODE_0_URL=`curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network | jq -r '.result.ThisNode | [.ID, .ListenAddress] | join(""@"") | ascii_downcase'`
sed -i s%PUT_HERE_NODE_0_ID@LISTEN_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS%${NODE_0_URL}% .burrow_val1.toml
```

this behavior is consistent with Ethereum and is not a bug. You cannot instantiate an abstract contract on chain.
The `deploy` job in the epm.yaml comprises two steps: a) compilation (which works fine) and b) deployment to chain (which fails).
The above contract would show the same behavior if you tried to deploy it on a public Ethereum chain.

It might help us to make the Burrow's project more flexible and robust.
But before that let me tell you why we decided to refactor `Account` object and how it's ended up to the PR #800.
In the Hyperledger-Burrow, Mutable and Immutable interfaces are introduced to work with account object and we didn't want to have different scheme for validator object. So we decided to follow the same approach.
In the other hand Account object has exported structures among the interfaces. It's something that I believe it's not a good practice and should be avoided. Interfaces in go are introduced to achieve polymorphism. We might use it to introduce some behaviors and functionality, but at the same time exporting the struct type will bring more complexity to the code. More important, by exporting struct type we allow the outside world to initialize the `account` object without having any control on it. 
This is why we made `validator` struct unexported and introduced two constructors for initializing account object. This caused another problem, there is no way to use go packages for unmarshaling bytes to an interface! We solved this issue by implementing our own serialization methods. You have commented about it [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/780#pullrequestreview-123992228). The serialization implementation is verbose and it could also be non-deterministic. 
We are in a trap! Having Mutable/Immutable interfaces is the root of the problem.

So I think to get out of the trap we should answer this question: *Is it a good approach having mutable and immutable interfaces for an object?*

I have some critiques about it. First of all it's not a known design pattern (two interfaces for one structure). The restriction comes after make the code more complex.
In the other hand, object are created to be alive. The user of an object should know how to deal with the object. Also casting operation for switching between interfaces is not a good approach. 

So we decided to refactor the account object. This is a big change, but it will make codebase more readable and easy to understand. For an open source project it is very important having simple and easy to understand implementation. The code should be easy for everyone with less programming knowledge to understand and debug the code.

Do you mean `ConcreteAccount`. Why do you think this should be avoided?

> More important, by exporting struct type we allow the outside world to initialize the account object without having any control on it.

What do we need to control? `ConcreteAccount` is a record type for which an exported type gives the cleanest initialisation syntax. Unless there is a clear safety reason then I think is unnecessary to hide the type, and hurts extension. In Go it is better to return structs and accept interfaces, having the struct public allows consumers to modify - where we want safety in execution we can use the interface or `MutableAccount` which has a `ConcreteAccount` as a private field.  

> We are in a trap! Having Mutable/Immutable interfaces is the root of the problem.

I do not see the argument for this - why?.Also to be clear - this PR does remove the `MutableAccount` interface.

I would like to draw attention to the following regarding this PR:
- My `Account` is still the read-only interfaces
- Your `Account` struct is my `MutableAccount` (now a struct with a private field)
- Your `accountData` is my `ConcreteAccount`
- Your `Account.data` is my `MutableAccount.concreteAccount` (note both private for when it matters - for mutations which we do want to control unlike initialisation)

Hopefully its clear from that how these changes are based on your account changes. However I have:
- Retained existing names which avoids renames in code for no good reason
- Exported `ConcreteAccount` - I disagree it is better not to export this serialisation model
- Kept a read-only `Account` interface

Your comment implies that there are still two interfaces - note that is factually incorrect. My assertion is that this PR solves all the problems your one does - indeed it is based on it - but isolates the changes and honours existing code and conventions.

I don't have time for a full review today so thought I'd dump a couple of things:

1. You'll need to make the integration tests pass `make test_integration` before we can merge. Before you do that make sure we've got the model right.

2. I like the KISS of `*Account`, however I do not want to lose the immutability when accounts are passed to objects that should not mutate them, e.g. in the EVM, state, and RPC layers. I would like _some_ kind of read-only interface, for example we could do something like: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/blockchain/blockchain.go#L36-L44. I think we can dump `MutableAccount` though I prefer just using `*Account`

Almost everything should use the read-only interface and not `*Account` - which is what we currently have with the `Account` interface - I'd like something similar put back.",2018-06-13 10:17:31,2018-06-13 10:19:23

Also in case it doesn't come across in my comments I'd like to make the point that I think you're changes are massive and really valuable. I need to spend more time reviewing to make deeper comments on some of the implementation.

With a view to merging these changes I was thinking about the following. Please let me know if this will work for you:

1. I will try and create a view abstractions around the basics of validator set changes that are compatible in spirit with yours but will allow us to build a few different models on top of Burrow (including the Pool/Sortition mode).
2. I will create a PR to develop to try and get these merged and I would appreciate your review.
3. I will ask you to rebase on develop which will involve some reorganisation and layering of your code.
4. I will try and reframe your VRF, sortition as a Burrow extension/plug-in - I need to have a play around but one way to do this would be be using an actual go plugin: https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/ and making that configurable in Burrow (dynamically loaded). This will allow you iterate more easily separate from Burrow (if we can get the interfaces right). Alternatively we can get your stuff in an extensions/contrib package in Burrow (and still have it configurable)

Another thought I had was combining `SendTx` `BondTx` and `UnbondTx` into a single `SendTx` over as multi-asset balance. There would be various detail to work out but essentially a certain tagged balance could be associated with bonding policy (in your case adding a validator to the `ValidatorPool`), but in other cases as with the Agreements Network it may imply activating a contract or adding a `ValidatorSet`",2018-05-30 10:23:22,2018-05-30 10:23:49

I do agree with you. Better to make this PR in several pieces. I try to make another PR soon for just sortition/Bond/Unbond tx.

I had the same idea, but since we need public-key for bonding tx, we can't do it right now. Please check here: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1625 and https://github.com/tendermint/abci/pull/245#discussion_r189504378",2018-06-01 04:38:25,2018-06-01 04:42:54

Roadmap is important info to check for any new project,
and usually one can find such link from README

However in this repository development goes not in default branch `master` 
(that is also is displayed by GitHub), but in `develop` branch.  
That let me think that the project is abandoned for first half hour I was studying it.

Maybe you should change default branch in GitHub to be `develop`

master is still our release branch, the reason is hasn't been merged to recently is stabilising a major refactor. I had been waiting until I was ready to cut the next release before I merged to master (which I plan to do in the next two week sprint, which starts tomorrow). However, I think all that is really required for a merge to master ahead of the release is the updating of some docs. I'll endeavour to do this this week.

I need to update the roadmap on the Hyperledger wiki. Much of it still applies, I have a newer draft internal roadmap for our own network and product much of which are general features for Burrow.

I was planning to upgrade Tendermint (again) soon, but had been stabilising develop for a network deployment first.

I'd love to review your changes related specifically to the Tendermint upgrade, but I'd need you to submit them in isolation.

To respond to your other stated changes:

> remove validators from blockchain object (it's needed to show validators per round)

I do not understand your purpose here, but in any case the validator set on the blockchain struct is currently a stub for re-introducing some form of validator set changes (aka validator bonding). It will be mutated by transactions with an appropriate permission. This is a change coming soon.

> Rename Validator to GenValidator in genesis.go for better code understanding

Why does this give better understanding. I'd take some convincing that we need a cosmetic change like this things other tooling and deployments depend on this name. I had also opted to remove tags for the JSON name as unnecessary busywork so this would also need justification.

> Remove vendor folder from project (it's not necessary)

Dep has golang on the way to being a grown up language with respect to dependencies but it's not perfect. We relatively recently decided to vendor our dependencies and I'm not inclined to change it again. Having vendor included serves two purposes: 1) we can be go-gettable, and 2) where we are used as a library we can maintain our own independent set of dependencies. Our licensing is also more clearly auditable with vendor checked in.

It would be good to chat if you'd like to contribute here: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/burrow-contributors. I have a draft roadmap that I would like to share, but have been heads-down trying to stabilise Burrow after a major refactor.",2018-04-10 18:12:23,2018-04-10 18:12:34

I think we can have this PR open until you decide to upgrade tendermint.

I think validator-set should not be part of blockchain structure. Maybe `type tip struct` is better place to track validators after bondin or unbondig. In each round validator-set can be changed, so it's needed to get validator-set for each hight. Currently burrow just shows validators in the latest height.

For me as a person who check the code for the first time, I got confused between genesis validator structure and acm.validator. This is the reason I renamed it for better code understanding. Other structure like Account can have Gen prefix. But if you think it'snot a good idea, just ignore it.

I know the go dep is not perfect, however by upgrading the dep I always get lots of changes from vendor folder. So far I never had any issue after removing vendor folder. reinstall_vendor_deps always works fine for me. If you want to keep it, you can ignore my changes.

Later if you want to upgrade to tendermint-18 you can count on me.

Thanks for your wonderful work on Burrow. It's well mangedand I love it.

## Diagnosis
The one to watch is `BlockCache.Sync()` my least favourite piece of code that still remains in the refactored Burrow. It's a ghastly bit of code and it looks like it is repeatedly hitting expensive merkle tree and database calls. I need a bit more time to look into why but this cache is scheduled for annihilation soon anyway. I just had been planning to do some other integration work first.

BlockCache holds a cumulative cache of account state between blocks preserved to speed up EVM operations. It is not meant to mark cache lines as dirty if they have not been modified, but it looks like it is doing some hashing and database ops for every account it has seen every block which is why you see a cumulative slowdown as the unnecessary work grows linearly per block. Effectively we are paying for over 100 transactions per block. 

It's not immediately clear to me why this would only be showing up now if it was such a generic issue though - there may be some slightly non-obvious interaction with the code in question. I will need to do a bit more work to understand exactly what is going on.

## Temporary proof-of-concept fix
I have what I think is a proof-of-concept fix here (**please try this version of Burrow and tell me if the issue seems to be resolved**):

https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/tree/perfo

(it is branched from `2748007` of Burrow which your reproduction is based - this is because there are some minor breakages between the released version of legacy-contracts and latest develop).

See the commit implementing the 'fix' here: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/commit/a0f877d707f5110bfa16fe75bdeeb4a6f1762957

For me (with one quick test) this seems to return us to a steady state of ~1% CPU usage when the chain is just making empty blocks as we would expect.

## Real fix
The real fix is to rewrite `BlockCache` which already does other badness by writing directly to database rather than through the proper interfaces. This is on my agenda within the next few weeks, but I also need to introduces some features so we may need to adopt the temporary fix in the interim. We will also be updating our merkle tree implementation for other stability and speed improvements.",2018-03-13 23:47:27,2018-03-14 08:44:27

I'll reply now rather than waiting until I've fully considered everything:

1. I'm inclined to include this functionality - but not expose it in config (yet) - we need a way of splitting up config in general and I think this probably encourages behaviour we don't want to encourage (i.e. keys in config file). I think local keys need to be in a properly permissioned separate file and for there to at least a warning if they are not.

2. I'm inclined to butcher some of what you have done and rework it so that we have something like a self-hosted set of keys. We will shortly be adding 'co-located signing' as in you can get Burrow to sign transactions if it has access to the signing key via keys. It might make most sense to pull in monax-keys wholesale for this - or at least a library portion of it to just make it 'something Burrow can do'.

I am not against the idea of self-hosted keys in Burrow. I am wary of introducing private key matter into Config.

However I'd like to step back and thing about what we are trying to achieve here, I think:
1. Run Burrow in a single process without keys
2. Be able to form a genesis doc to start a chain - which requires the public keys

One idea that I like is that of the validator creating its own key on boot and gossiping its public key around in a 'lazy genesis' process. The key does not need to leave the node. If the node goes down and it has not persisted at least to disk its key this does mean it would need some means to be rebonded on to the network which is probably just moving the problem around - and we tend to think of validator keys as durable identities that may have some long term value attached.

Another option would be to effectively still run a monax-keys service, using the same code, but running it in a single process. I believe that changes I have recently made (https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/commit/e9a65a5814e7421d71b08f1a9e232ea561e09650) mean that we could relicense it to Apache and pull it in. We have always wanted to point out that monax-keys is unaudited crypto, but it is built on solid libraries and I think we should probably give it a higher status (and ultimately get it audited). The option of replacing it with a remote HSM-based service should always be there.

If we went for this option then I would pull in keys from: https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot/tree/master/keys and we would add the necessary configuration to run keys as a launched service of Burrow but maintain the same interface boundary (just not use a HTTP transport). There could be the option of having Burrow also act as a key server for local applications.

As I write this I find myself leaning towards this option for a number of reasons. We also need to re-introduce secp256k1 which would be more easily done working within a single repo. Needs a bit more thought though. What is your view on this?

Thanks for encouragement also, it's good to see someone using our develop branch at this stage.",2018-02-28 12:37:16,2018-02-28 12:43:12

I agree private key within the Config file is not a target, I am trying to start Burrow as an API in my own process: this way the wrapper is responsible of storage and lifecycle of the node private key.
I have yet to understand Tendermint and Burrow impacts on the block consensus and vote algorithm if we generate keys at bootstrap.

I didnt check monax.keys recent changes, actually I didnt manage to start monax inside docker-for-windows, but that's another story!

I have pushed [in this commit](https://github.com/phymbert/burrow/commit/faf186698257c32ba16d8ec867be2dfbed89ef1c) changes I would like to see in Burrow, I am sure to move directly mature and existing code of monax.keys is a better option, feel free to tell me wether or not I can submit a PR.

However, I believe the bytecode you are running probably runs elsewhere (remix), could you share the bytecode that causes the panic.

1. We need to wrap `Execute(tx) error` with panic/recover so that any downstream panic in the execution engine is handled as an error. This addresses not only this issue but the entire class of 'panic on tx' issues - rather than crashing the chain we will just reject the transaction. I've been intending to do this for a while - but needed to fix our internal API a bit. Now is a good time to do it!

2. We need to (this is the royal we - I mean I need to) change our memory implementation so that it does not accept negative offsets: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/execution.go#L153 - it probably makes sense to use `uint64` here, though they are not so good for arithmetic/have their own issues.

Burrow is not `go get`able since we don't vendor our dependencies. Maybe it should be (I am working on a release where it is). If you want to install a development version you'll need to get the repo (go get has done this, don't worry about the no buildable files message) and install our dependencies using glide, do:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow
make install_vendor
make build
```

You'll then find binaries under `./target/burrow`.

Bear in mind at this time the standard way to interact with Burrow is through the `monax` tool: https://monax.io/docs/getting-started/. We are transitioning to a more standalone experience.",2017-09-16 19:25:46,2017-09-16 19:25:46

I still have the full state of the blockchain where it dies, however, the way I was getting it was by calling solidity code from a swift binary, neither of which are practical to share. 

I have not had time to isolate more and do not foresee to have time to do so in the near future.

I can share the full state of the blockchain if that helps, where you could identify why it dies during the replay?

I’m fine to close the bug as well if I’m the only one affected by this.

The CI is failing because there is a mock `transactor` that will need the `BroadcastTxAndHold` method added which I can easily do.

Splitting out `Hold` makes sense, and I don't see why not to have `BroadcastTxAndHold` as a method.

I think your solution is an improvement on what we have and is a pretty good heuristic, but I think we can still have the situation where an identical recursive call is made to the contract (with the same `CallData`) and we would still have the problem. I think the fundamental error is that we fire call events in post-order:

https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/manager/burrow-mint/evm/vm.go#L145

This allows it to catch any errors and output, so really it's a `AccCallComplete` event. We could introduce a `AccCallBegin` (or maybe `AccCall` and rename current `AccCall` to `AccReturn`...) that is triggered in pre-order. Then the first call event would be the one at the top of the stack, which is what `*AndHold` methods want... I think that might be a more general solution. Thoughts @benjaminbollen?

Which instability of the websocket API are you referring to? On 1337?",2017-07-14 12:33:24,2017-07-14 12:51:53

I only saw it after I did the PR, and didn't  find the time yet to update.

you're right on the identical call problem. I leave it to you guys to decide how best to handle.

re the instability of the websocket api, I only have circumstantial evidence for now. But I have noticed since 0.11.x (and up until 0.16.x at least) that when I use my libs (pure web sockets on 1337), after a while, the web sockets server on the burrow side stops broadcasting, and the only way for me to subscribe to events again is by killing the bc node I connect to and restarting it. Usually, this behaviour is triggered by killing a WS connection ungracefully (killing the connected socket due to time out for instance or killing the process). restarting the process alone without restarting the bc node did not help.

Additionally, when using the latest develop branch (cut from early July 2017), I noticed that burrow recovers from certain errors (can't remember which) when sending json-rpc calls through HTTP, but dies when the same requests are sent through WS. I suspect that some exception is not properly caught somewhere.

Anyhow, for now, quite busy on other stuff, so I don't hv a lot of time to go deeper in there for now.",2017-07-14 12:45:04,2017-07-14 12:45:04

I have a tool that I use here: https://github.com/silasdavis/glide-lock-transitive which may allow you to do what you want.

Until we have a better solution for us it is a question of maintaining the glide.lock by hand. Which is not ideal, but in my opinion is better that not having a manifest at all.

1. A thought on this. For `MLOAD` we are hitting an unnecessary copy when we push the the value to the stack:

```go
func (st *Stack) Push(d Word256) {
	st.useGas(GasStackOp)
	if st.ptr == cap(st.data) {
		st.setErr(ErrDataStackOverflow)
		return
	}
	st.data[st.ptr] = d
	st.ptr++
}

// ...

func LeftPadWord256(bz []byte) (word Word256) {
	copy(word[32-len(bz):], bz)
	return
}
```

For cases like this (where we want a copy _somewhere_ downstream) we could provide a function on the `Memory` interface `func ReadTo(offset, length int64, destination []byte) ([]byte, error)`. Then implement `LeftPadWord256` as `ReadTo(offset, length, word[32-length:])`. The other main occasion that we `Read` is to get the input for calls `CALL`s ultimately these are pushed to stack (obligatory copy). So if we passed `input []byte` from `call` as `input Memory` we could postpone the copy and have `ReadTo` do it whilst still maintaining safety. Again... probably not an optimisation we need now...

2. I'm logging `memErr` at least for now.

3. If we were to sort out our gas pricing to be fit for our purposes then we wouldn't be doing any worse than other famous EVM implementations with this memory model. Essentially memory is priced rather cheaply (1 `MSTORE` cost per 16 MiB!), but at least it is bounded by a linear function in number of `MSTORE`s (alright also `CALLDATACOPY` and others, but still)

It is actually a real fail. The reason is a breaking change in go-rpc:

From ws_client.go:

```go
// Subscribe to an event. Note the server must have a ""subscribe"" route
// defined.
func (wsc *WSClient) Subscribe(eventid string) error {
	err := wsc.WriteJSON(types.RPCRequest{
		JSONRPC: ""2.0"",
		ID:      """",
		Method:  ""subscribe"",
		Params:  map[string]interface{}{""event"": eventid},
	})
	return err

// defined.
func (wsc *WSClient) Unsubscribe(eventid string) error {

		ID:      """",
		Method:  ""unsubscribe"",
		Params:  map[string]interface{}{""event"": eventid},
	})
	return err

- Refactors Solidity-specific code into a util package and introduces a templating wrapper, and some formatting improvements (like proper indenting)
- Introduces an `abi` package under `evm` to decouple Solidity types and calling conventions from those defined by Ethereum by way of the ABI (this can be one path to future expansion to support an ABI-aware chain more generally)
- Improves documentation and naming of variables on contract
- Changes the 'value' argument on `set_*` functions to be a bool as it should be
- Changes the return value of `*set_*` functions to be the resultant permission after the permission operation has applied (rather than echoing back the argument the caller passed in). This retains the primary purpose of the return value as a truthy call success flag.
- Reverts the returning of `Zero256.Bytes()` from `Dispatch` since error return values should be and are handled by the called (vm.go) here: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/manager/eris-mint/evm/vm.go#L857. If there is an error return then zero is pushed to the stack by the vm so it can't have been the cause of some invalid jump dests observed. Since the existing snatives return nil I think it is confusing to break with go convention and return zero to the stack without clear semantics on what should be done in this error case.",2017-02-20 17:56:36,2017-02-20 17:59:47

It does seem like there can be a problem here and your solution will in some sense work. However this is a special case of a broader problem. That is making sure we have some special case handling for snatives. The other obvious place this will be an issue is `EXTCODECOPY`:

https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/manager/eris-mint/evm/vm.go#L583

in fact `EXTCODESIZE` seems like it probably is designed be used in tandem with `EXTCODECOPY` to copy contract code around. We would need to handle some special case there too at least.

What is the context of use here? Pretending a native contract exists and has code length 1 may make certain code execute, but it doesn't make it make any sense, seems ad hoc, and does nothing to allow you to treat native contracts as if they have code accessible in contract-space. It seems like the best thing to do here might be to just make in an error. But we need more context about where this was encountered.

Another place where we don't check whether we are dealing with an snative, and perhaps we should is in `CREATE`: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/manager/eris-mint/evm/vm.go#L763

Here's the relevant line in the solidity compiler that generates this type of code: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1662

The check amounts to an existence check for the contract/contract code before running it. I am not certain why this is, but it seems like in the current pricing model it might be better to check the code exists before calling empty code. Worth checking.

In this compiler case returning any truthy value seems to be the right thing to do, and 1 is probably the most elegant.

There is a worry with how this interacts with `EXTCODECOPY`. It could easily try and copy non-existing bytes into allocated space. However as a point of reassurance, a quick grep of the solidity compiler code does not seem to show any use of `EXTCODECOPY` by the the solidity code generator.

If someone is deliberately trying to access snative code from an `EXTCODECOPY` then we have a problem, but an error is probably the right thing to do there from the time being. We _could_ return stub code, but that seems like it would cause more pain than it might prevent. `EXTCODECOPY` is a low-level thing, and I think solidity is our main concern...",2017-02-08 16:34:33,2017-02-08 16:34:33

The response given by Eris has the right values in the _accounts_ member, but the presence in the response of both the _error_ and _result_ members means that it isn't a right JSON-RPC 2.0 response according to the specifications (http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object) as it seems that the error member ""MUST NOT exist if there was no error triggered during invocation.""

So when I receive that response and the Java library I'm using parses it (http://software.dzhuvinov.com/json-rpc-2.0-client.html), it gives me this error: ""_com.thetransactioncompany.jsonrpc2.client.JSONRPC2SessionException: Invalid JSON-RPC 2.0 response_""

If I use some Java reflection trickery and I manage to remove the error member entirely (`{""result"":{""accounts"":[{...},{...}]},""id"":""0"",""jsonrpc"":""2.0""}`), when the Java library parses the response it gives me no errors at all and it returns a correct Java object.",2017-01-30 14:51:02,2017-01-30 14:51:12

It's a bit more than just a change from always assuming a CallTx to handling any types of Tx. The json representation of the asummed CallTx is also not consistent with how it's expected in the wire protocol (see txs/tx.go file, where the concrete type is defined for the wire protocol). 

Ideally, this regression (introduced in 0.12.x) can be fixed for 0.16.0. 

The way transaction types are handled (array with type byte followed by payload) is exactly the same as how pubkeys and signatures are handled so it should not be too hard to bring in line. 

Let me know if/how I can help.

https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/439,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/comments/274339453,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/439#issuecomment-274339453,silasdavis,"I ended up answering this on StackOverflow before coming here, so here's my response from there. Could you update as to whether it does seem like your subscription is getting reaped (as outlined below):

We have two different APIs at the moment. The one you are using we call the 'v0' API. It is optimised for long-polling Javascript clients. My guess is that your subscription is getting reaped before a certain hard-coded timeout that happens to be 10 seconds. Have you tried making the `eventPoll` call in quick sucession after the `eventSubscribe` call?

This is the 'v0' reaping function: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/master/event/event_cache.go#L72. It runs in a loop clearing out old subscriptions that have not been polled recently. If you have waited longer than 10 seconds before polling then your subscription has probably been reaped (deleted).

We have another API optimised for chain administration called the 'tendermint' API (because of its heritage from the Tendermint consensus engine). It is something of a parallel API and it is used by the eris-pm tool. It also has a subscribe method accessible by a websocket endpoint. This might be useful for you because its subscriptions are never reaped.

You could try it out like this:

Start your chain:

    $ eris chains start testchain

Get a simple websocket client:

    $ go get github.com/raphael/wsc
    
Connect to the websocket endpoint:
    
    $ wsc ws://0.0.0.0:46657/websocket
    2017/01/21 01:03:51 connecting to ws://0.0.0.0:46657/websocket...
    2017/01/21 01:03:51 ready, exit with CTRL+C.

Subscribe to the `NewBlock` event by pasting `{ ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""method"": ""subscribe"", ""params"": [""NewBlock""] }` into the terminal as a single line:

    >> { ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""method"": ""subscribe"", ""params"": [""NewBlock""] }

Then you should receive a stream of new block events (about 1 per second) like:

    << {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":""#event"",""result"":[19 {""event"":""NewBlock"",""data"":[1,{""block"":{""header"":{""chain_id"":""testchain"",""height"":206320,""time"":""2017-01-21T01:04:01.095Z"",""num_txs"":0,""last_block_hash"":""2DB0D0AE6D92DA6DA07F8E7D1605AAB6CB96D8D2"",""last_block_parts"":{""total"":1,""hash"":""A4AD1708714CF0BE3E5125B65F495DDDFA1ED8D9""},""last_commit_hash"":""4C301C0367B7CECDD4E00C955D2F155802B2377E"",""data_hash"":"""",""validators_hash"":""46E43215C6C332446114BF7320D2D007114C5EEB"",""app_hash"":""9A72DE9AAD6BD820A64DB98462CD706594217E1

You could use a programmatic websocket client of your choice to interact with the chain using this websocket API and your subscriptions will never get reaped.

I strongly disagree with this categorization. eris-sqlsol saves web clients from scraping blocks, how would segment.io do that? Do web clients connect to segment.io in this model? a web client facing cache isn't an ETL, but that same interface can be expanded upon to provide ETL access without having to provide or support an additional interface.

This also doesn't replace the needs of operators to ""ship log files"". This can be exposed by just using the standards Silas is already looking into. I don't see why this needs to change.

You heard it on a call on Friday for one :stuck_out_tongue:. And ETL is a massive need across a range of users as you've told me multiple times.

I did not characterize this issue as solving the caching problem for all use cases (although in some it would, with a much more hefty db behind than sqlsol's in-memory sqlite provides). in the web client's scenario, they could connect into the postgres, redshift, or bigQuery db however the application maker has things set up if they needed a direct connection to the DB; or the application maker could use sqlsol (which I'm not advocating that we do away with...yet) instead of this feature. 

of course application makers can always build their own ETL and caching using solidity events if they have non-standard caching requirements.

> a web client facing cache isn't an ETL, but that same interface can be expanded upon to provide ETL access without having to provide or support an additional interface.

I don't understand this argument. sqlsol is currently doing ETL plus DBMS operations. From eris:db's perspective ETL features don't exist. So there is still ""another interface"" from the stack's perspective. I admit this would be a new interface from eris:db's perspective. 

However, I don't see why we would want to expand the ETL interface sqlsol currently provides to be able to push to ""bigger"" DB's (which I assume we can all agree is a necessity for application makers) when we can utilize industry leading ETL providers who do it every day. 

Should we ship this feature and folks find it useful, at that time, I would probably advocate that we do deprecate support for sqlsol as a standalone library. So it wouldn't be an additional interface, but rather movement of a optional interface from outside the service to inside the service.

This feature is orthogonal to ""shipping log files"", you are right it does not replace the need to ship log files, nor was it intended to.",2017-01-08 21:21:56,2017-01-08 21:21:56

I suggested that the customer might need ETL support on the call...  I think moving eris-sqlsol functionality into ErisDB (exposing blockchain data as relational database data) *based on a client ask* is the correct solution. Once we have a clear client ask we can decide if we want to embed a relational database, use unix sockets, expose a Relational DB port, etc etc. Without a clear use-case, it feels like fishing.

I think there is some semantic confusion here. I think we need an ETL from blockchain to SQL, nothing more. If a customer asks for it, we should be able to provide them SQL read-only endpoints that speak the read-only subset of SQL93.",2017-01-09 00:07:25,2017-01-09 00:07:25

And perhaps I need to refactor the problem statement to reflect this. 

Segment does this:

```
event source -- segment's etl -- integrations (over 100 integrations to highly used systems)
                              \- warehousing (3 integrations: redshift, bigQuery, bring your own postgres)
```

I don't disagree with you if we are treating it as part of a cache for web client and other (similar) types of interaction that it's sub-optimal design. I agree that it could be worthwhile, given a customer request, to explore exposing an SQL93 API/RPC or other ETL options for caching requirements.

The reason I think we're talking past each other is that I think you are focusing on the primary value in the feature being event - etl - warehouse whereas I think that the primary value is event - etl - integrations. For me, warehousing is a nice to have.

To be clear, the primary first customer of this feature will be LEI Chain's Application. The use case we have is that we want LEI Chain Application to be able to do a few things such as:

* populate our salesforce data based on information which resides in LEI Chain.
* send Slack notification when new participants sign on, or perform other high value user interactions.
* hook into monitoring tooling to make sure the production chain stays live; raise alerts when validators go down.
* And probably other features down the road.

My view is that to plug in to all of those systems is a lot of low level code that we can very simply avoid by using an ETL integrator. At least in the first instance, a simple connection to an ETL integration platform like segment is a very cost effective interface to maintain and enables a broad range of eris:db built applications to interact with other business systems (in my view at least).",2017-01-09 01:14:16,2017-01-09 01:14:57

1. you're marrying eris:db, to some proprietary system you have no control over.
2. just exposing SQL is easier, already useful, orders of magnitude boarder adoption, SQL93 isn't changing anytime soon, once you expose it properly you're done, no upstream syncing.

> 2. just exposing SQL is easier

Here is where I'm confused. How would exposing SQL make it easier for users to trigger event streams they can route into other business systems that application users and builders utilize? (genuine question because I may be missing something fundamental to your argument)

Unless I'm missing something fundamental, exposing SQL from eris:db would still require middleware to listen for and trigger event streams. Users that wanted to connect those event streams to other business systems would still have to build their listening & routing mechanisms for those events individually per API to their other systems. Whereas they wouldn't using an ETL aggregation platform.

I am not following your argument as to how BFT or RBAC have anything to do with users having a clean ability to pipe events into other systems. 

If we were talking about using an ETL aggregator *instead of* a more complete caching mechanism that provides a queryable interface for datasets then I can see and do not disagree with your concerns. However, I do not see a sink for event stream initiation as being on point with dataset caching. Maybe I'm missing fundamental about your argument though. ",2017-01-09 10:13:00,2017-01-09 10:13:00

Any ETL tool will be able to load data from a SQL store. If we are agreed that we want to expose that (I think we are) then it seems we would automatically be providing basic support for something like segment. With that in mind:

1. What first-class support (i.e. beyond a SQL event log), if any, for segment are we proposing here?
2. Where would this support live?
3. Does any such support need to be _in_ eris-db? 
4. Does any such support need to be in a service running alongside the eris-db node or is it just an orthogonal collection of tools to help importing into segment?

To frame the discussion a bit, and having discussed with Tyler, I am envisaging for our rawest (least derived) form of event log a telemetry log of point-like events with a timestamp, that spurts out of a hose to interested parties that can infer events with duration and system state by combining these simple events. I think initially we are talking about putting this raw log into a SQL database to make it queryable, and this would be part of eris-db. This simpler, rawer SQL schema would then define a pinhole interface into eris-db. Where possible it seems desirable for more derived analytics to be driven off that, with eris-db in blissful ignorance.

It's sounding more and more like you folks want to integrate postgres. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-notify.html

>Unless I'm missing something fundamental, exposing SQL from eris:db would still require middleware to listen for and trigger event streams.

Agreed. I think this should be more tightly coupled to eris:db than eris-sqlsol currently is, but we are blind men describing an elephant if we don't have a client ask. This very question is what prompted me to start working on a BFT-DB in the first place.

>I am not following your argument as to how BFT or RBAC have anything to do with users having a clean ability to pipe events into other systems.

Trust issues (BFT and RBAC) are always core considerations in any blockchain architecture. Can a malicious user break your integration point by spamming a contract? How are permissions on the blockchain side replicated on the ""ETL"" side?

>However, I do not see a sink for event stream initiation as being on point with dataset caching.

Postgres has been handling both of these concerns in production environments for a very long time. Databases do a lot of enterprise business logic... nearly all of it. So whatever we are trying to do, various production databases already do and have been doing since before we were born. ",2017-01-09 13:05:15,2017-01-09 13:05:15

The starting point and need for this feature is listed above in the LEI Chain section. Functionally I'm neither advocating that we try to rebuild postgres nor would postgres solve what I'm talking about.

So, what am I talking about? I'm trying to find an easier way for users who want to pipe events that an eris:db node knows about into other business systems. 

I'm not trying to do this via a database sync, nor am I talking about providing any database dynamics. I fear that my invocation of both sqlsol and ETL may be leading the discussion in a direction different than intended. 

So before going any deeper, let's just decide whether the following questions are a yes, and if consensus is no then we should stop discussion close the issue and move on.

- do we agree that users have a variety of different business systems (many of them SaaS and API based; others legacy enterprise infrastructure with enterprise bus's large postgres deployments, etc.) that users will want/need to pipe **event information** (which typically began in the contracts layer) into?
- do we think that there is a case to be made for eris:db to pipe events into other systems without users *having* to develop their own middleware solely to listen and route events to a webhook?

Again, this is about event notification. This is not about ""what are all the contracts on the chain"" or ""what block was transaction hash X in"". 

If we have consensus that the above two questions are yes then we can talk about the specifics of this issue and how we would implement it, if we do not then we should not continue wasting time on this discussion.

@silasdavis in response to your points. 

1. segment and other ETL platforms don't really work on SQL event logs (although I assume they could be made to) but rather on [arbitrary ""track"" events](https://segment.com/docs/sources/server/go/#track) which are sent to a collection webhook. To be clear the feature discussion (for me) is less about the specifics of segment and more about the paradigm of enabling easier integration of outbound streams to an events aggregation platform such as segment, stitch, or zapier.
2. It could either live natively in eris:db or users could take eris-contracts spin up a watching node and route their events from there. If we did implement in eris:db functionally the feature would do the following: `POST events A, B, C to webhook endpoint url Z`. Nothing more.
3. No (see 2) it does not, strictly speaking, have to be in eris:db. I think it would be much cleaner to have event streams be pipe-able directly to arbitrary listening webhook endpoints but given the discussion on this issue perhaps I'm alone in that view.
4. I'm not sure I follow your question.",2017-01-09 15:07:17,2017-01-09 15:07:17

I had also thought about streaming events to something like Kafka/Flume. It ought to be straight-froward to write a sink that publishes to the segment tracking API (https://segment.com/docs/sources/server/http/) without eris-db needing to know specifically about Segment. The nice thing about this is it could support many different consumers. I think we ought to be able to support Amazon Kinesis (based on Kafka) too. ",2017-01-09 17:12:47,2017-01-09 17:12:47

If the aim is just to support code using `ecrecover` then adding this back will allow solidity code using `ecrecover` execute successfully. But it will do nothing to make solidity code that assumes secp256k1 keys are being used give correct results. If you provide it with a ed25519 signature it should provide you with an address, but that address will not be the one corresponding to the signer. So in effect we will just have silently failing code (which is worse than not supporting it at all).

So it seems (unless I'm mistaken) this only makes sense if we introduce/add back support for secp256k1 keys. If we do that, how do we deal with ed25519 signatures? It seems like Ethereum have plans to introduce support for other signatures (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/28) so do they have a way to deal with it.

It would be useful to see an example usage of `ecrecover` in a contract. @VoR0220 could you provide one. I think I need to understand where these signatures are coming from; are they being provided by the EVM (I don't think it is) or are signatures being sent as arguments to functions?

```javascript
        address signer_address = ecrecover(result_hash, v, r, s);
        uint256 result_value = uint256(result_value_hex) / p.base_unit;

        LogSettlementAmount(result_value);
        if (signer_address != p.oracle_address) {
           LogFail(signer_address);
           LogFail(p.oracle_address);
           return false;
        }
```

It seems in that example since the arguments for ecrecover and the `oracle_address` are all being set externally, then it is down to the clients interacting with the contract to make sure secp256k1 keys are being used and passed in. If they are then it would work. The key types we happen to be using for participants of our chain do not matter.

Whereas it would fail if, for example, the `msg.sender` address was being checked rather than an externally set address, and if that sender was not using a secp256k1 signing key.

I suppose if it is acceptable to push the responsibility for ensuring those entities participating in your contract that uses `ecrecover` are using secp256k1 then it is okay to support this.

Sorry about the delay in getting back over Christmas. I also wanted to circle up with some internal RFC process we have around this area.

There is a new logging system in 0.16.0 that I think could be put to use to solve your issue. It would require a fairly small change to hook our internal calls to `FireEvent` through out own event multiplexer. We had always intended to further centralise the handling of events so this is for the good in terms of architecture. We can then have a special purpose logger receiving events in a fire-and-forget fashion (writing to a non-blocking ring buffer so we don't risk disrupting the system). The new logging system allows you to set up a pipeline of 'sinks' that can transform (e.g. filter) the output before passing it on to final output sinks or other sinks. The point of this is that it is all done through configuration. So to support your use case we could just need to implement an `HTTPEndpointOutput` for example.

As I mentioned to you in person I am also considering supporting Kafka for this purpose that would deal with resiliency (crashing consumers/producers), book-keeping, and scaling as well as integrating with other things. It seems like we could add support for a `KafkaProducerOutput` in similar way plugging into this special-purpose logger.

Which would be more useful for you? Also thinking about the events and their metadata what format for the events would be of most use to you? Exactly like you would get over a API subscription? We may need some kind of wrapper given if we are sending many different types over the same channel. Is there anything other system state that would be useful to get from a single hose?

We do need to be careful about dumping potentially sensitive state out to logging, particularly if we are sending all events not just those that you have asked for. I think by separating this from the general-purpose logger and making sure it is deliberately requested will help somewhat. Would a mass-subscription pipe work for you - that is where you still have to provide account addresses you are interested in but you can provide them in bulk and receive on same channel?",2017-02-02 11:18:10,2017-02-02 11:19:03

The kafka producer sounds great, actually it is the approach we want. For now it could we a single topic and all the events generated on the contracts are dumped there, but we think for get the maximum from kafka a topic for each type pf event would fit better. 

We thought of and event serialized in Avro with the metadata in the header. Will this fit you? Will be doable?",2017-02-14 12:17:34,2017-02-14 12:17:34

In all the cases you have cited nil (equivalent to empty byte slice) is returned when an error is also being returned. When this happens the vm handles it here: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/release-0.16/manager/eris-mint/evm/vm.go#L885

As you can see, if an error is returned then the vm pushes `Zero256` on to the stack. So I don't think the nil returns can be the source of the invalid jump dest (I think @VoR0220 had another theory?). It is idiomatic to return nil from go functions when an error is also being returned so I have reinstated these. Returning 0 at these functions may lead to a false reliance on a default value without knowing the caller's context. When an error is returned it must be handled by the caller. In effect though the behaviour that I thought I was adding is actually already in place via the EVM.

So I think the invalid jump dest you were seeing must have another cause. It might be worth re-checking this against current release-0.16 branch were we have made breaking changes and improvements to the snatives and permissions contract (some along the lines of your suggestion).",2017-02-23 14:25:18,2017-02-23 14:33:12

It's not good that the permissions map is just some alien reference.

The primary issue here is the inaccessibility of `set_global`. I am reluctant to make cosmetic changes to the casing of the function names that will break backward compatibility, is there a strong reason to do this?

You are correct on the `uint64` point, but again I am reluctant to change the signatures of the working methods for little benefit. Bear in mind that since a PermFlag bitfield is really a way of encoding a more complex type into an integer being slightly tighter on the outer type seems to buy us rather less than it would if we were representing a strictly non-negative number.

Personally I think the permissions interface could do with a more significant overhaul and no expose PermFlags at all (though it could still use them internally), and rather a more simple-minded interface that allows you to set flags on a permissions object. Currently the bit-twiddling approach allows you to set unsupported values and requires knowledge of the permissions representation that seems unnecessary...",2017-02-08 11:45:03,2017-02-08 11:45:03

The issue is that the array length is written too the boundary of the memory (the result of the `MSIZE` call). This is a aspect of the solidity compiler which I believe I have traced to this code:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L842-L851

The reason it does this is still a little obscure to me and I am also missing how this works on other EVM implementations since it is effectively deliberately writing to memory out of bounds.

I have a fix in hand that provides dynamic memory allocation (since we have cases where our 1 MiB memory allocation is insufficient also causing out-of-bounds), but I need to also understand how this behaviour is supported elsewhere (even if it triggers resizes it seems rather odd to be continually writing to the end of memory however big that memory is, and so could cause run-away allocations).",2017-05-09 14:03:57,2017-05-09 14:03:57

A bit of context : 
- The chain i'm using has 6 .js files (using eris-contracts) all running simultaneously. 
- They are all listening to an ""opening"" event from a contract and all transact pretty much at the same time.
- Once they are all done transacting, the contract sends another event, prompting the contracts to transact once again and wait for another round.
- This process is repeated 6 times.
- The chain usually crashes after 3 or 4 rounds.

2. Loop through all ""bundle"" directories under /src/*

It seems to me that risk here is if you accidentally mix two correlated sources of entropy. Then you may up with less entropy, take the extreme case `B = A ^ A` for some byte stream `A`, then `B = 0, 0, 0, ...`. If the sources are independent, then provided one is statistically random then xoring it with any independent source won't change the probability of the parity of a bit in the result, it will still be 0.5 for either 1 or 0.

The risk of accidentally correlated sources might be enough to make this a bad idea... Also aren't we relying on good PRNG sources, this seems like a rather ad hoc way of mitigating against a bad one...",2016-11-25 17:24:56,2016-11-25 17:26:19

We will work in two steps: first detail and decide what the maximal support we can provide in this respect is. Note that we support the ethereum protocol, and as such solidity contracts can be compiled as normal and run against the eris chains.  However in order to provide some of the features unique to the eris chain (no proof of work and transaction finality; bonding of validators, etc) makes that these two fundamentally different chains (eth public chain vs eris) cannot be treated at all levels as the same.

We understand the value to our users to drive rpc differences down to an absolute minimum.  So we will take this first step very serious and look for the best compromise.  The second step is of course, implementing this proposal.  You can expect to follow this discussion in more detail this week on this and possible linked issues.

With respect to `eth_sendRawTransaction`, there are two ways we can consider this:
1. evaluate switching our transaction format over to the Ethereum formulation, under the condition that the additional transactions we require for, eg bonding, permissions etc have a clean extention on the Ethereum transaction format.
2. provide a new eris transaction type that wraps an Ethereum public chain transaction formulation.

Note that in both cases we will regardless need to look at providing support for secp256k1 signing of transactions; eris transactions are signed with ed25519.

We cannot stress enough how important it is for us to not create different standards as this burdens the innovation within the community.  Regardless, I hope from the above it is already clear this is tangled into a bigger decision than merely providing an additional set of RPC endpoints.  We really welcome our users and the community to join us here in this discussion.

Hope that helps,
Ben

pieces we definitely do not need:

Anything tied to Whisper (though this may be nice to implement in the future as a service)

After following your argument and the code myself, I am equally confident that this is - regardless of whether it fixes https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-pm/issues/212 - a legitimate bug that was there.  The expanded use of library contracts has started to showcase the bug which was unimportant because indeed we are generous with the initial available gas.

(another indicator is that it was correctly implemented for native contracts (on https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/pull/305/files#diff-cad6213f6a08c87e4110c4006789e2b7R811).  

If you want to add an evm unit test (or an rpc integration test, if the event structure can't easily be mocked out), then that is great too.

LGTM. ready to merge and pull to master -rc2 and -rc3 when you're happy with it.

But in our case we have following execution:
1. First matching AccCall event arrives
2. Blocking send of event data into channel `wc`
3. Receive of event data on `wc`
4. Callback unblocks
5. Second matching AccCall event arrives
6. Blocking send of event data into channel `wc`
7. No further reads on `wc`, callback remains blocking... (`FireEvent` is blocked)
8. transactAndHold tries to unsubscribe but can't because it needs the same mutex `FireEvent` has locked

So what we have is doubly bad:
1. The execution of the VM is halted waiting for the return of `FireEvent`
2. transactAndHold is blocked waiting for `Unsubscribe` to return which is deadlocked over a shared mutex with `FireEvent`

Here's my suggestion to go-events to fix it: https://github.com/tendermint/go-events/pull/6

Also just thinking about our code here.... The reason this arises is partly because we are only expecting to see one AccCall event with matching transaction receipt hash, but we see two. we ought to be able to better distinguish the original call made by the transaction and the subsequent ones. The contract that shows the bug is:

```
contract MyTest{                                          
    bool 

    function call1(address contractB)public{
        result = MyTest(contractB).call2(this);
    }

    function call2(address contractA)public returns(bool){
        bool mycall = MyTest(contractA).call3();
        return mycall;
    }

    function call3()public returns(bool){
        return true;
    }

    function getResult()public returns(bool){
        return result;
    }
}
```

Perhaps thinking about this is for another day, but it maybe raises the question of what are are the proper 'fire and wait' semantics. Do we just want the first call event triggered, the last?

https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/258,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/comments/300529545,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/258#issuecomment-300529545,silasdavis,"@somak12 so having looked into this, the initialisation-time dynamic memory arrays (size is a parameter you pass the constructor at runtime) are not yet supported as return values by the EVM. As you correctly point out on remix (browser solidity) it does work, and I am told this is implemented as something of an internal work-around in web3 that uses internal knowledge of their state to allow for dynamic array returns. From a pure EVM level and so Solidity it is not currently possible.

The problem is that when you make a `CALL` you have to specify the return position and size in memory ahead of time, but that is not known for dynamic arrays, see here for more detail: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/164. So there is not a general solution in Solidity. However there is a proposal to provide a mechanism in Ethereum to do this more efficiently via two new opcodes see: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/211. I would expect us to support that in due course once added to the EVM spec.

In the meantime, the following will work (will return the arrays) (I have been trying this against #607):

```javascript
    function getMarket() constant returns(uint[20], uint[20], uint[20], uint[20]){
        uint[20] memory optionIDs;
        uint[20] memory strikes_;
        uint[20] memory positions_;
        uint[20] memory cashes;
        uint z = 0;
          for (uint i=0; i<10; i++) {
            optionIDs[i] = i;
            strikes_[i] = i+10;
            positions_[i] = i+100;
            cashes[i] = i+50;
            z++;
          }
        return (optionIDs, strikes_, positions_, cashes);
      }
```

If you want to use dynamic arrays internally (as in without returning those values) then you will be able to do so after #607 is merged.",2017-05-10 15:59:42,2017-05-10 16:02:28

""Caller"" and ""Callee"" can get a bit confusing because we an intermediate account (named B below; the delegate) that is both caller and callee.

Suppose we have 3 accounts: A, B, and C with the following psuedo-code contracts attached:

A: 

```
int n := 0
address addr := nil

CALL B
```

B: 

```
int n := 0
address addr := nil

DELEGATECALL C
```

C:

```
int n := 0
address addr := nil

n++
addr = msg.sender
```

Then the result of invoking A (message or transaction) should be the following sequence:

| Stack | A | B | C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [] | n = 0, addr = nil | n = 0, addr = nil | n = 0, addr = nil |
| [CALL B] | n = 0, addr = nil | n = 0, addr = nil | n = 0, addr = nil |
| [DELEGATECALL C, CALL B] | n = 0, addr = nil | n = 1, addr = A | n = 0, addr = nil |

That is B acts a 'delegate' for A in terms of the message sender and value, but like with `CALLCODE` it is B's storage that gets updated by the code in C.

in the code, opcodes `CALL` and `CALLCODE` will start a new stack and memory by calling the funnction `Call`, which atomically transfers the value from caller to callee; then calls the function `call` which executes the ethereum opcodes;

I understand that the value sent with the `message` (starting a new stack+memory) does not require the value sent from `A` to `B` to be passed to the delegated contract `C`; a few notes:
- whether or not to pass on this value from B to C; does not affect the succes of e-pm test `app35`
- go-ethereum code - from my reading - does also not pass this value to the delegated contract `C`

This implementation only allows a single subscription to the same event from the same host. On the face of it that might seem okay, but it puts the onus on the client to maintain a global websocket connection pool per event and reuse/share the same one for the same event. This isn't terribly nice for writing less stateful Javascript apps and furthermore there is no warning that by re-registering the event will clobber any previous connections (they will no longer receive the event). This is because AddListener in go-events overwrites any existing callback:

```
func (cell *eventCell) AddListener(listenerID string, cb eventCallback) {
    cell.mtx.Lock()
    cell.listeners[listenerID] = cb
    cell.mtx.Unlock()
}

The preferred method of calling the function in a contract is via the function attached to the contract object in eris contracts as this will automatically format the transaction according to the contract's abi and erisdb will not. For example if your contract has a function MyFunc(arg, arg2). And you got a contract object either from the .new or .at functions then contract.MyFunc(arg, arg2, callback(err, data)) would be the correct way to call it. You can also use contract.MyFunc.sendTransaction(...) to ensure you form a transaction as opposed to a query which would be contract.MyFunc.query(arg...). The difference between these two is that in a query no transaction is formed. The transaction is only simulated. This means that no state change will occur.

I hope this helped clear things up.

Perhaps not, my point doesn't really amount to much more than ""metadata is good""

Having the ChainId on the Tx interface is convenient whether or not we include on the wire.

Issue recreation is below. Thanks!

Bytes32 Issue Replication:
I made a contract that takes in a bytes32 data type and returns it. The contract is interacted with via the NPM package eris-contracts. After running an application in javascript that interacts with the contract, a null type is returned rather than the input.
I did the same thing with type string, but with string, no null type is returned. Rather, the input is correctly returned. This contract is also below.

epm.yaml:
```yaml
jobs:

- name: deployStorageK
  job:
    deploy:
      contract: testing.sol
      wait: true
```

JAVASCRIPT APPLICATION:
```javascript
'use strict'

//for calling contract:
var contracts = require('eris-contracts')
var fs = require('fs')
var http = require('http')
var address = require('./epm.json').deployStorageK
var abi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./abi/' + address, 'utf8'))
var accounts = require('./accounts.json')
var chainUrl
var manager
var contract


var request = require('request');


//API for chain
chainUrl = 'http://localhost:1337/rpc'
//instantiate contract object manager (uses chain URL and account data)
manager = contracts.newContractManagerDev(chainUrl, accounts.demochain_full_000)


//Make the contract object using ABI and address of deployed contract
contract = manager.newContractFactory(abi).at(address)


contract.passVal(""this is of type bytes32"",function(error,result){
        console.log(result);
})
```

CONTRACT:
```javascript
contract testing{

function testing()
{
}

function passVal(bytes32 val) returns (bytes32 theVal)
{
        theVal = val;
}


}
```

When the contract above has the type changed from bytes32 to string, it instead works. Here it is:
```javascript
contract testing{

function testing()
{
}

function passVal(string val) returns (string theVal)
{
        theVal = val;
}


}

```
contract.passVal(""this is of type bytes32"",function(error,result){
        console.log(result);
})
```

here you're passing a string to a function that expects a byte32, but you're not sending it hex characters.  The string would not be auto-converted to hex (as it would be impossible to determine whether the string already is hex or should be converted. )  Arguably we should error more clearly here.

Please tell me if I am fully and completely misunderstanding the problem at hand here.

Seems like we need a human-maintained whitelist of keys, where we can check identities against something like keybase.io and have some degree of belief that commits link to a somewhat known identity.

This might fit in well if we decide that we need a contributor license agreement (CLA) to be signed by individuals contributing.

Another general advantage is that we only add a specific key, and we don't end up with commits from unknown keys being mixed in with a pull request seemingly from a known identity. I wouldn't imagine us trying to do a very deep audit on identities as this would be onerous and somewhat against the spirit of open source.

Note there's two configs, one for eris-db (using actual structs, defined in eris-db/config), and one from tendermint (using the tendermint/go-config abstraction).  this is merely about the latter. 

In other words, I don't think ""there are still 10 locations where the deleted global config is used"" is true. did you try running it?

`tendermint init` is to drop a simple genesis.json so you can start the chain.

It reads ""config.toml"", should this not be moved back to ""server_config.toml"" - at least for now.   Then it works for me (ie produces blocks)

Currently it reads with above instructions the tendermint config.toml, then produces a runtime error when unmarshalling the toml config file into the ErisDBConfig struct, reading from it on L96.  Preferably we also panic on the error to read the config.

- Update eris/tendermint to match the [godeps vendored tendermint in eris/eris-db](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/tree/master/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/tendermint)
- Sync the vendored version of tendermint with eris/tendermint
- Pull up the tendermint repository to the top level of this repository
- Make tests pass
- Factor out some of the tendermint/\* stuff then pull tendermint/tendermint to top level
- Make tests pass
- Make eris-db depend on appropriate packages in eris/ethereum (for current VM)
- Remove [old tendermint VM](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/tree/master/Godeps/_workspace/src/github.com/tendermint/tendermint/vm)

I like tendermint/go-rpc because it exposes the same endpoints as GET requests (so we can see in browser), as jsonrpc POST, and as websocket messages. of course the js libs use the erisdb ""rest"" api but I believe there have been some issues there and dave has even started using the 46657 api.  granted there's no rush on this but maybe we should put @NodeGuy in charge of this interface since he's responsible for the js tools which will be talking to it, and we can make the mint-client tools conform to whatever he thinks is best for the API here.

`updateState` is being used by dennis right now, lets leave that. It has some changes we might want to merge to mint-client/mintdump instead.

`fixes` has the project genesis fixes and some other stuff. i'll merge it this week for the 0.11.3 release.

`ethvm` is branched from `fixes`. it will be the branch for 0.11.4 (hopefully!) and will include geth's vm (hopefully you can help out getting it there).

`tmsp` I'm targeting for 0.12.0, which should align with `eris chains` refactor. It will inherit things like the `ethvm` and other fixes going into the 0.11 series, but by the time we're using tmsp all the peer/consensus stuff will be in tendermint core (or whatever other consensus erisdb plugs into), so many of the fixes made to erisdb are already replicated there  (ill compile a short list of what's missing - ie. p2p handshake with genesis state root).

Hope that helps.

but looping over a map is non-determinisitc
so when epm goes to deploy, whether it deploys one or all, it will be in a different order every time
so either we need to be smarter with the return object, or we want to preserve order in the compiler (probably not)
and it seems like we also shouldn't be doing ""Deploy all"" on app17 at least

```

The test fails on getGSAddr, but the actual problem seems to be the step before, where `Return Value` is empty for `createGSContract`. 
Presumably, the return value should be the address of this new GSContract, so let's find out why we never got (maybe the contract was never created).

First off, we need more logs. Using `--debug` with `eris pks do` gives us that. Here's the relevant output (from a different run than the above one):

```

So the job  `createGSFactory` is calling the contract `8A7ADFC12D7A157824AD4B36780A658E2B01FC49`, specifically the `create` method, which has the function id `efc81a8c` (function id is the first four bytes of the data sent to an ethereum contract).

Let's go search for `8A7ADFC12D7A157824AD4B36780A658E2B01FC49` in the chain logs, so we can see what went wrong when we try to call it. Here are some places that address shows up:

Note how the execution is very short and just STOPs. Solidity contracts have functions which are called by passing a 4 byte function id. 
The first thing the contract does is try to match the id against its available functions. Here, the id is `EFC81A8C` (the id for `create`).
But note, it checks it against two other values:

```

```

So this contract has functions with ids `60FE47B1` and `6D4CE63C`. So let's take a look at the ABI files for our contracts and try and find what these ids correspond to.

```

Aha! So `60FE47B1` and `6D4CE63C` are `set` and `get`, respectively, which means we deployed the GSContract when we thought we deployed GSFactoryFactory.

This means there's some non-determinism somewhere.

Take a look at deploy code (eris-pm/perform/jobs_contracts.go):

```
}

    // loop through objects returned from compiler
    switch {
    case len(resp.Objects) == 1:
        log.WithField(""path"", p).Info(""Deploying the only contract in file"")
        r := resp.Objects[0]
        if r.Bytecode != nil {
            result, err = deployContract(deploy, do, r, p)
            if err != nil {
                return """", err
            }
        }
    case deploy.Instance == ""all"":
        log.WithField(""path"", p).Info(""Deploying all contracts"")
        for _, r := range resp.Objects {
            if r.Bytecode == nil {
                continue
            }
            result, err = deployContract(deploy, do, r, p)
            if err != nil {
                return """", err
            }
        }
    default:
        log.WithField(""contr"", deploy.Instance).Info(""Deploying a single contract"")
        for _, r := range resp.Objects {
            if r.Bytecode == nil {
                continue
            }
            if strings.ToLower(r.Objectname) == strings.ToLower(deploy.Instance) {
                result, err = deployContract(deploy, do, r, p)
                if err != nil {
                    return """", err
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

From the logs we see that we triggered `Deploying all contracts`. This is first of all wrong - we only wanted to deploy GSFactoryFactory, not the other two contracts also in that solidity file.
And the result from deploying the last contract is what we return.
But more worryingly, the order is obviously randomized, since sometimes we deploy the right contract and sometimes we don't. But `resp.Objects` is list, which is ordered,
and there's no maps in eris-pm that might be relevant (remember iteration over maps is non-deterministic). So let's look at compilers code.
Grepping for `map` shows us the Solc.Contracts map, and we eventually discover this gem (eris-ltd/eris-compilers/server.go):

```
                respItemArray := make([]ResponseItem, 0)

                for contract, item := range solcResp.Contracts {
                        b, err := hex.DecodeString(strings.TrimSpace(item.Bin))
                        if err == nil {
                                respItem := ResponseItem{
                                        Objectname: strings.TrimSpace(contract),
                                        Bytecode:   b,  
                                        ABI:        strings.TrimSpace(item.Abi),
                                }   
                                respItemArray = append(respItemArray, respItem)
                        } else {
                                fmt.Errorf(""Error decoding contract string\t=>\n%v\n"", err)
                                return &Response{
                                        Objects: nil,
                                        Error:   fmt.Sprintf(""%v"", err),
                                }   
                        }   
                }
```

which is randomly ordering the solcResp.Contracts (a map) into the respItemArray!

TADA!

Thats what tmsp and 0.10.4 branches are based on. 0.10.4 is just support for eris-keys signing for consensus. maybe we roll 0.10.3 into 0.11, and shoot for the 0.12 release being just supporting the eris-keys signing for validators (that will involve most elements of the stack harmonizing on fixing their tests to use that).

// proposal:
// ipfs_db acts as a persistent (levelDB) db that additionally stores
// the values to IPFS, and stores the retrieved IPFS hash for the stored value,
// under the key.
// It is proposed that only the value []byte are stored to IPFS,
// and not the key []byte + value []byte.  The main argument is that the
// key []byte + value IPFS hash, can be separately stored to IPFS; however,
// at the user level the structure of the data might desire a more optimal
// graph structure where the key-value is absorbed into a named link of a
// higher object (commit or transaction block).
```

An initial draft of the proposal is here (wrongly in tendermint/go-db, but it was ""easier"" or more clear for me to start there).  This is clearly needs to be moved to eris:db/tendermint before any merge, as it intends to depend on eris-ltd/common/go/ipfs, where I will also open a PR.

This is telling you that you'll need `gcc` installed on your machine.

You may need to do some googling around to find the best way to get gcc and also lib-gmp installed for your machine. 

One thing to make sure of is that eris-db definitely _does not_ support 32 bit arch on Windows. 

Gonna leave the issue open because we do need to fix that second error. Once you have gcc installed change the referenced line from `isWritable` to `IsWritable`.

If you would like to natively install rather than use docker to isolate the environment that is not a problem, but these are very different paradigms.  

If you would like to use the cli platform then you should not need to worry about the compilation vagaries for eris-db on windows. If you want to install erisdb natively then you will need to (at least) install gcc and correct the line mentioned above.

Let us know if you have any other errors on windows native install besides correcting that line 15 and installing gcc and we'll try to make this path a bit smoother for folks who wish to natively installed eris-db.

If you do not have a config.toml in ~/.eris/chains/chainname then just copy the config from ~/.eris/chains/default/config.toml and make the change. Next time you run ""new"" it'll catch up faster.

If you'd like to change it for a running chain, stop the chain, then `eris chains exec chainName -i` (that will enter you into a bash shell ""inside the chain's"" containers). From there edit ~/.eris/chainName/config.toml and `exit`. After you exit out of the shell restart the chain and things should catch up faster.
