- @silasdavis 

Currently in most blockchain designs we do not have an ability to schedule future processing. However there are many useful reasons why such a feature would be leveraged. This ticket summarizes the two key user stories for leveraging such a feature.

### User Story A: Account Driven Scheduling

As a properly permissioned user of a burrow blockchain, I need to be able to send a transaction at `time.Now()` that is properly signed and has the transaction signature along the lines of `destination, executionTime, data`. Upon receiving and ensuring such a transaction is properly signed and permissioned, the nodes operating a burrow network should schedule this transaction for execution in the block which covers the unixTime placed in the `executionTime` with the original sender built into the transaction envelope. 

### User Story B: Contract Drive Scheduling

As a properly permissioned user of a burrow blockchain, I need to be able to deploy a contract that can interact with the scheduler in a similar manner to the user story listed above. ",open,False,2019-04-03 15:31:51,2019-04-03 15:31:51

1. Previously we were using `ConstSummary` but without calculating quantiles it requries (a previous commit changed us to use `ConstHistogram` which was closer to the usage, but on closer inspection...

2. We were binning TxPerBlock and TimePerBlock into a map and passing this to `MustNewConstHistogram` but reading the docs (which could probably be a bit clearer) this is not what it requires - in fact it wants a cumulative frequency distribution (see https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram)

This also cleans up the code, adds tests, removes a swallowed error, avoid stringly typing, etc.

- SyncInfo includes the interval (block duration) between the last and one-before-last commits

- Default logging excludes trace (now inverted to `Trace`) and filters Tendermint logs for a much quieter default

### Expected to happen
Nodes will connect to seed node and request addresses, then they will connect to each other and start submitting and voting on blocks.

### Actual Behavior
I am trying to connect multiple nodes to seed-node with help of this [documentation](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/quickstart/seed-nodes.md). 

I have started seed node and assigned  seed node id to all other validator node and started all nodes. But no nodes are connected to seed node and also they won't connect with each other. I had uploaded the full logs, you can see that at the link below.

> **SeedMode = true**

If i keep SeedMode true than no nodes will get connected with seed node and also didn't connect with each other. As per the documentation validator nodes needs to be connected with seed node and after that they will be connected with each other. But in my case nodes can't get connected with seed node.

This is my **current** network of nodes:
```
$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:10001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
(no result)

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
(no result)

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:30001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
(no result)

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:40001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
(no result)
```

This is **expected** network of nodes:
```
$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:10001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:20000
tcp://0.0.0.0:30000
tcp://0.0.0.0:40000

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:30000
tcp://0.0.0.0:40000

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:30001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:20000
tcp://0.0.0.0:40000

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:40001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:20000
tcp://0.0.0.0:30000
```

> **SeedMode=false**

If i keep SeedMode false than there is different behavior all the validator nodes get connected with seed node and seed node get connected with all the validator nodes but validator peer didn't connect with other peers. Validator only connects with seed node.  Below is network for all the nodes:
```
$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:10001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:20000
tcp://0.0.0.0:30000
tcp://0.0.0.0:40000

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:20001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:10000

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:30001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:10000

$ curl -s 127.0.0.1:40001/network | jq -r '.result.peers[].node_info.listen_addr'
tcp://0.0.0.0:10000
```

I can't figure out what is the problem. Is there issue with SeedMode?

### Steps to Reproduction
I followed this documentation: [Seed-Nodes](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/quickstart/seed-nodes.md)

### Expected to happen
Two peers connected with each other and empty blocks automatically created Sending vote message and Finalizing commit of block with 0 txs

### Actual Behavior
I am trying to connect multiple validator with the help of this [documentation](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/docs/quickstart/multiple-validators.md). I followed each step described in the documentation. But when i start node i see following error in logs.

For some sets of contracts this should save a fair amount of storage and simplifies providing on-chain ABI storage: #858.

Some considerations:

- We will need to change the `account.Code()` to store a reference. We could just store the hash as bytes, but at this stage we might do well to consider the possibility of alternative bytecode formats (i.e. WASM bytecode). Even then we could still use a single consistent hash, but we may want to use a self-describing hash. I have looked at https://github.com/multiformats/multihash in the past.

- Currently deleting a contract deletes its code (well... it would if we didn't keep every previous version of our forest - perhaps this in itself makes the point moot - we have considered abbreviating our versioning - i.e. thinning to snapshots in distant past). Under this model we would have a garbage collection issue - i.e. knowing when the last reference has dropped. Minor issue but we should note our approach.

- With a view to establishing a link between code hash and EVM ABI it would be useful to understand under which circumstances marginally different bytecode (i.e. solidity writes a metadata footer to the EVM code) actually maps to the same ABI. I suppose we can just duplicate registration/storage of the ABI. What about reverse lookup? Do we care?",open,False,2019-02-19 17:07:14,2019-02-19 17:07:14

This is a core part of providing synchronised vent/burrow.js access and can also be used to build a resilient external event system.

In particular the log table now emits a `{""_height"": ""<the block height as string>""}` payload on the `height` channel for chain synchronisation purposes - wait for the height in a `TxExecution` and you know the database will be caught up with chain (for exact synchronisation with fields you can set a notification on a particular event table and subset of fields).

By specifying `Notify` channels as an array in the `EventClass` that table will register a row trigger that fires an event on each channel that is referenced in that event class/table spec. The payload sent by `NOTIFY` will be the JSON serialised collection of key values from `FieldMappings` for each mapping in which a particular channel is referenced.

In adding this functionality it was clear there were a number of problems with the structure being used to represent mappings, so included in this PR are various changes (including breaking changes that I will document with a subsequent commit), including:

- Case sensitive column names
- Clear separation between event field names and the columns to which they map
- Deletion marker made less busy just expecting a named field
- `burrow vent schema` now generates a JSON schema to check the event spec against
- EventSpecs can be merged together provided they agree on table definitions exactly
- Height is handled as a uint64 rather than a string (though still stored as varchar - we may want to use numeric but the way things work it doesn't hurt us as it is)
- A number of renames and restructuring to make the code more logical and easier to understand (e.g. `s/Parser/Projection` - parser was not a parser)",closed,True,2019-02-07 15:11:27,2019-02-18 19:02:13

Go: 1.10

Given Contract A which has an array and Contract B that is querying the Contract A, the keys that is queried from the state ReadWriter uses the Contract B's address rather than Contract A.

I have an example using `burrow deploy` that highlights the problem here: https://github.com/swetharepakula/burrow-deploy-test. The example is adapted from the [Truffle Pet Shop Tutorial](https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop).

There are two main contracts, Adoption and AdoptionTest. Adoption has an array that stores the owners of the pets. When the AdoptionTest adopts a pet, we can query the Adoption contract to see that the array has updated the owner of the pet to AdoptionTest's address. However from AdoptionTest when querying Adoption's array we get the zero address back.

I initially tested this in the EVM and was able to get this queries that were sent to the state ReadWriter Interface when both contracts are querying for Adoption's Array:

Adoption (0xb047ca4869fbc70b9bb3829a0a13d3c680f85d60)

burrow,compleatang,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/1008,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/1008,Fixes vent's behaviour when it cannot find ABIs,"Currently when vent fails to find an ABI for an event it reads from the
chain it just exit(1)'s. This is nonsensical behaviour on complex chains
which may evolve and especially on public or semi-public chains where
the operational unit running a single instance of vent may not be able
to control a given event type+filter. The way vent currently operates
it would be trivially easy to take down a system by deploying a contract
which it's ABIs are not registered with vent instances and have that
contract emit events which are filtered in other's vent instances.

This patch starts to change that behaviour by refusing to fail when an
event cannot be decoded (this happens in pretty much every case when
vent doesn't have the ABI for an event). Instead vent logs the _txhash
and error for further decoding by operators if they need to do so. Vent
still will fall over in the previously defined cases and will fall over
if it cannot save the error log in the table. So that behaviour is not
modified by this patch.

**Note**: this patch will require some tests; however due to other
obligations I do not have time to add those just now. I'll leave that to
another of the burrow maintainers for now.

This was because we were iterating of a map when updating dirty trees. It felt like this would not matter but of course IAVL is order dependent and our commit tree is an IAVL tree.

`KVCache` was also soaking up tens of seconds as used by `CacheDB` because of excessive sorting. It could be sped up by maintaining a sorted list and performing sorted inserts but since keeping it was a marginal act of database sync paranoia I've opted to remove it.

We note there is a slight speed-up by using a single storage tree rather than one for acocunt, but since this was a major motivation behind introducing `MutableForest` and the speedup is modest compared to the above we avoid reverting that for now.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/1006,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/1006,Change unit of aggregation in state to BlockEvent,"With the inclusion of dump/restore (in its current incarnation) we have the possibility of a very large zeroth block. Each time we dump/restore a chain we import all EVM log events into a zeroth pseudo-block. So this block can grow without bounds.

However GRPC has a relatively small message size limit of 4MB (https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/7927). The streaming RPC is designed to be used for large messages by breaking them into multiple parts. We have a natural batching with block and transaction but currently we store entire blocks in state. We would like to be able to naturally stream blocks in terms of the their transactions, however just streaming transactions makes it difficult to know when you have received the last transaction in a block. We work round this by introducing `BlockEvent` that can be either `BeginBlock`, `TxExecution`, or `EndBlock` (similar to the tendermint ABCI types). The block messages serve as delimiters.

This PR changes our fundamental execution event state to a stream of `BlockEvents`. Some remarks on this approach:

-  We can pull out a single transaction without decoding an entire (potentially very large) `BlockExecution`
- It relegates blocks (from the point of view of `State`) to being secondary to execution events (which kind of feels right given the separation we have between 'our state' and 'tendermint's state'. The aim is that state is only faintly aware it is running on a blockchain (whether this really makes sense is up for debate - but it does have some advantages for things like checkpointing and restore)
- We could go further and wrap `TxExecution` so we have a 'pure' event stream - for various reasons this seemed like going too far (would affect a lot of code and require a lot of reassembly). I decided in the end that `TxExecution` was a good unit to work with (indeed it is a transaction).
- However since block boundaries are our synchronisation markers, so when consuming a stream of transactions you often want to know when you have reached the end of a block (and code is nicer if you can still do this with a single stream).
- Consumers can still consume `BlockExecutions` with the function `rpcevents.ConsumeBlockExecutions` hiding the details of their reconstruction - so they just benefit from the streaming transport.

This PR also includes:
- KeyFormatStore construct to make sure we do not have colliding prefixes in state and improve readability
- Slight change to Vent - it chose to remain in an invite loop when receiving EOF (on non-streaming bounds) which did not seem like the right thing to do.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/1004,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/1004,[Transactor] Notice if a mempool signed transaction is double submitted,"If we send two identical unsigned tx payloads to two burrow nodes within the same block interval - they will both attempt to mempool sign the tx. If they are successful they will both checktx locally successfully too. However two burrow nodes will assign the same sequence number (since the mempool signing is only montonic within a single node because locks are held in memory). This means they will both send the same tx (same bytes, same hash).

This is a race. In the tendermint logs we will see that one gets included in a block and one will be flagged as duplicate `Tx already exists in cache`. It will never get committed because the sequence is wrong (even if retried).

However BroadcastTxSync subscribes purely by the TxHash for the result. A valid TxExecution will be broadcast internally by all burrow nodes so both clients (to each burrow node) will receive a successful return. But only one will have run!

This is a misuse of mempool signing it is down to you to only use the same input account with the same burrow instance when using mempool signing (we can't do any better than that with this feature). However it is _bad_ that we lie to the submitter of the rejected transaction that it has been processed successfully.

For example if two clients call the same function:

`function addVote(bytes32 name) (bool added)`

With `addVote(""pedro"")`

Both receive a return of `true`. Between them they should expect two votes have been counted for pedro but only 1 will have!

To avoid this I think validators performing mempool signing should themselves too be inputs to the tx and sign it. They will act as multisig countersignatories and by the presence of their sequence numbers (and the uniqueness of validators) these two transaction will be recognised as different transactions (different bytes, different) hash. The tx that loses the race will still get rejected, but this time by sequence number, and the submitter will be informed.

Here's a thing we could do:

```go
type Tx struct {
	ChainID string
	payload.Payload
	// Maybe call them 'countersignatories' or something...
	Inputs []*payload.TxInput
	txHash []byte

- Every 5 minutes, 1 contract was deployed and 100 transactions were made to this contract (a setter function was called, which also emitted an event)
- Every minute, the CPU and memory usage of one of the burrow processes were logged as CSV data
- Every 5 minutes, the total size of the blockchain directory of one of the burrow processes was calculated and logged as CSV data
- Empty blocks enabled, one block every 1s

Disk & CPU seemed normal. Memory kept going up however, (up to 1 GB). Possibly a memory leak?

The parsing and syntax is provided by some regular expressions mixed with string splitting and other logic that is very far from declarative. Also the structure of the variables you can access is untyped and depends on the job you are referencing, for example:

```yaml
# could be an address from a deploy job
- name: queryStorage
  query-contract:
      destination: $deployStorageK
      function: get
# in a query-account we get named fields
- name: queryPerm1
  query-account:
      account: $addr2
      field: permissions.roles
# In a query-vals we can have jq style deep queries with substitution thrown in!
- name: CheckPower
  query-vals:
    field: ""Set.${AddValidator.address}.Power""
```
A much better tool for this sort of work would be text/template. This would firstly give us a decent non-fragile syntax that already exists. The way it would work is by lazily evaluating all keys in our parsed yaml structure as if the are text templates and pass a global object representing the state of past (and future) jobs. This would give the same power as what we have now (the ability to dynamically reference variables initialised in earlier jobs) but we can give each job a strongly typed structure to query over which we can use a reference as what is available. Each job can have a struct describing its result rather than `interface{}` as it is now.",open,False,2018-11-08 12:43:49,2018-12-05 12:29:51

Chiefly the fact that the mutable account objects act as yet another (unnecessary and confusing) layer of caching that requires synchronisation between call frames.

To make this clearer I have introduced a direct read/write interface for the EVM that captures the state freshness requirements of the EVM. This also allowed for simplification of the account model transferring some of the functionality of `MutableAccount` to this interface and removing the rather complicated nested accounts structure.",closed,True,2018-11-07 13:19:51,2018-11-07 16:49:05

- [ ] `burrow version:` 0.22.0
- [ ] `what you expected to happen:` Send transaction in Burrow without exposing GRPC Interface
- [ ] `what actually happened:` Not possible to access kernel.Transactor

It would be useful to have access to kernel transactor to access Burrow directly from code without exposing any grpc port - keeping in mind the idea of Burrow as a Module.

## Example:
```go
type Kernel struct {
...
	State      *execution.State
	Blockchain *bcm.Blockchain
	Transactor *execution.Transactor // Execution transactor
...
}

tx := &payload.SendTx{...}
kernel.Transactor .BroadcastTxSync(context.Background(), txEnv)
txEnv := txs.Enclose(chainId, tx)
txEnv, _ := transactor.SignTx(txEnv)
transactor.BroadcastTxSync(context.Background(), txEnv)
```

If you are ok with this idea, I may submit a PR.

Changes included:

- `Prefix` and `KeyFormat` types for handling prefixed lexicographic keys consistently
- A `CacheDB` that wraps all changes within a block into a single DB transaction - i.e. Batch
- A separate 'tree' and 'refs' storage in state. The former describes those values that contribute to the state hash and the latter does not - this gives us more latitude in disabling, for example, block storage or running nodes that opt to store somewhat different derived data whilst agreeing the the core account state.
- Upgrade IAVL dependency to version including: https://github.com/tendermint/iavl/pull/107 

Some changes that may follow in a future PR:

- Content address account code for some deduplication
- Content address blocks to allow their hash to be stored in main tree for consistency (not sure about this one)
- Make block storage configurable
- Consider using a Trie implementation in various places including caches for some reduced string -> []byte copying.

- what actually happened: The `BLOCKHASH` opcode is currently a no-op

It would be useful to allow implementing the `BLOCKHASH` opcode in Burrow, as Seth provides this functionality (see https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/commit/b5475d45b2a4982fd83df1c7a572c284be65cf19 for where it was introduced to the vendored version of Burrow). The above-mentioned PR un-vendorizes Burrow, but runs into the issue of Burrow not allowing a way to call `GetBlockHash`.

The PR fixes this by overwriting bits of Burrow in the Dockerfile to introduce a `BlockHashGetter` interface used by `Reader`, and adding no-op implementations on relevant structs. This is a hack however, and should be added in Burrow proper. Is this something that could be added to Burrow?",closed,False,2018-09-11 21:29:51,2019-01-31 10:16:06

- operating system details: Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
- what you expected to happen: to be able to reset a uint or an int to zero 
- what actually happened: I cannot get this to work via yaml or solidity.
- steps to reproduction:

I've modified the storage.sol and epm.yaml from [this tutorial](https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot) to show the issue. 

Firstly see the storageIssueWithZero.sol below. Note that I have added two functions (setIntToZero and setUintToZero) to set the int/uint to zero within the code:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

contract storageIssueWithZero {

  int private storedInt;
  uint private storedUint;

  function setInt(int x) public {
    storedInt = x;
  }

  function setIntToZero() public {
    storedInt = 0;
  }

  function getInt() constant public returns (int retInt) {
    return storedInt;
  }

  function setUint(uint x) public {
    storedUint = x;
  }

  function setUintToZero() public {
    storedUint = 0;
  }

  function getUint() constant public returns (uint retUint) {
    return storedUint;
  }

}
```

Now my yaml test file is as follows:

```

- name: deployStorageK

    contract: storageIssueWithZero.sol

```
I would expect assertStorageInt2, assertStorageInt3, assertStorageUint2 and assertStorageUint3 to FAIL but they pass, indicating that every time I attempted to reset an int/uint to zero it did not work. 

I am not having this issue on remix. Also I have tried a version of the yaml file with a wait attached to every call, but that did not work either.

- `go version`: 1.10.3 linux/amd64
- operating system details (osx/windows/linux): Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS
- what you expected to happen: A solidity smart contract with an abstract function to be deployable
- what actually happened:  The smart contract was not deployable
- steps to reproduction:

Following [this tutorial](https://github.com/monax/bosmarmot) the burrow chain is on, contract storage.sol has been deployed and the tests in the epm.yaml file have passed.

Next I created a basic solidity file with an abstract function in named AbstractContract.sol:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

contract AbstractContract {

  function getBool() public returns (bool retBool);

}
```

This contract has no compile errors according to remix.ethereum.org. But it does not deploy to the chain. I added the following in my epm.yaml file to check:

```
- name: deployAbstractContract
  deploy:
    contract: AbstractContract.sol

- name: makeSureDeployed1
  assert:
    key: $deployAbstractContract
    relation: ne
    val: """"
```

The above fails. But if I change the AbstractContract to the following, the above will succeed:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

contract AbstractContract {

  function getBool() public returns (bool retBool){
	return true;
  }

}
```

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/830,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/830,Implemented GovTx,"This adds support and test for a `GovTx` which allows fairly arbitrary updates to be made to accounts by accounts with the (previously unused) `Root` permission. Currently it simply allows any account with `Root` to make the changes but it should be a relatively modest extension to make this based on a multi-sig threshold, and a further extension to build governance voting. This allows us to start using the dynamics of changing accounts post genesis. It allows you to change in bulk (i.e. you can supply multiple account updates):

- Account power balance (i.e. Tendermint voting power)
- Account native balance
- Account permissions
- Account roles

To follow will be the ability to update account code (bulk deploy) making way for a mechanism for network upgrades.

Related changes also included are:

- Upgrade to Tendermint 0.22.4
- Added mutliple typed account balances (currently only `Native` and `Power` type are implemented and currently only on `TemplateAccount`, but may make it to `Account` model proper
- Validator `Set` and `Ring` objects for modelling validator changes and bounding flow of power to less than one third. `Ring` holds a sliding window of deltas and cumulative powers that can be used to calculate a variety of rolling averages of validator power and availability which will be needed for fee calculation. It also serves as a cache/accumulator for validator power changes and gives us a history of validator changes for some consistency checks against Tendermint (checks are made in the ABCI App)
- Validator history method added to rpcquery service 

The next change will include command line tooling for building declarative 'make my chain this way' transactions via an extension to `burrow spec` and a new CLI command for submitting transactions from the command line (including and particularly for `GovTx`).

The next iteration of the the governance execution will be to provide an 'online' multisig whereby parties can submit candidate `GovTx` transactions signed by themselves that are only executed when other parties choose to also sign them. This will need a pending transaction service probably on rpcgovernance.

We also need to layer policies around bonding and unbonding on top of `GovTx`.

1. I have integrated gogoproto protobuf types tightly with many of our major types - this means everything eats the same dogfood internally as our RPC and gives us consistent models for most things
2. I have eliminate v0 completely and tm methods for events and broadcast - which entailed porting tests over to the new structure
3. I have stripped much of the event system complexity AND pulled in Tendermint's pubsub with a change to make it non-blocking

All of the RPC now runs off execution events called `BlockExecution` and `TxExecution` that mirror the Tendermint objects but contain the full execution trace as burrow sees it. These objects are meant to be self-describing and contain most data useful to querier.

```
When called with the parameter `block_within` which takes a `time.ParseDuration()` parsesable string then this endpoint will return with the same result as above if the last block committed has a `BlockTime` that falls within that duration counting back from now. If it does then the status is 200:

If not then it returns an error with status code 500. The last block info is embedded in the error (since we cannot return an error and result under the JSONRPC 2.0 spec:

We used a 1 nanosecond `block_within` interval in the above but the idea is the network operator can set the parameter to whatever they deem reasonable to probe either liveness or readiness. For simple liveness the no parameter version can be used.

Currently if we have a catastrophic incident on a node we have to remove it's `.burrow` directory entirely which cause a full resync with the entire chain.

  * do you have permissions to do what you're trying to do on the chain?

This core function added to state is:

```go
GetEvents(startBlock, endBlock uint64, queryable query.Queryable) (<-chan *events.Event, error)
```
and a GRPC based on this is provided by `ExecutionServer` that allows dynamic ranges (relative to latest block) to be specified as well as for events to be streamed continuously as they are generated by new blocks.

We sync events to our state tree before also broadcasting them over pubsub so existing functionality is still preserved.

This PR also:

- Reorganises protobuf and generation from makefile
- Fixes keys service using non-pointer receiver
- Fixes keys command checking keys options for nil rather than default values
- Adds `EventsService implementing with `Subscriptions`
- Adds `ExecutionEventsService` service state persisted events
- Further refines state handling and safety following through with some earlier changes to interfaces
- Improves read/write lock on state by maintaining a previous tree version for reading
- Provides an event endpoint with a query string
- Adds timeout to `SubscribeCallback` to prevent from blocking subscribers from halting pubsub
- Make multiple `NewBlock` event subscriptions safe

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/805,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/805,[Logging] Implement logging hotswap endpoint with presets support,"Burrow produces a large volume of logging with no filters and `ExcludeTrace = false`. This can be a burden when capturing logs across many validators and chains. Often we are temporarily interested in an increased amount of logging - often regarding a particular area, e.g. consensus, p2p, EVM, accounts,... For example when deploying contracts with Bos we may want to up the EVM logging to max in order to debug issues. Similarly if a node has lost connectivity it is useful to ramp up the p2p logging.

Burrow has two core latent features already implemented that can be combined to provide just this functionality.

1. The logger supports concurrent hot swapping of its output logger (which can contain an arbitrary pipeline of filters and transforms): https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/logging/logger.go#L112-L114

2. There exists a system of logging presets that can be defined to provide a particular verbosity or topic focused logging: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/logging/config/presets/instructions.go

What we would like to do is:
- Define a logging service in our new GRPC layer: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/rpc/burrow/burrow.proto (for reference see: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/rpc/burrow/transaction_server.go)
- Have this endpoint support a `Swap` method that allows you to specify either a preset logging mode from instructions.go or a custom logging config provided as JSON/TOML payload. Either config can be used to hotswap the output logger to a new one.

Once that basic functionality is in place it would be nice to have:
- Logging presets defined in Burrow config to augment hard-coded ones
- The ability to define new presets at runtime (by supplying a name when calling `Swap` with a custom config)

To make this really useful we should think about presets that are operationally useful and try and come up with some good default presets. We can work with the Monax product and operations team who have good experience in production and can provide feedback.

Here is a suggested logging RPC protobuf interfacce:

```protobuf
service Logger {
    rpc Swap (SwapLoggerRequest) returns (SwapLoggerResponse);
}

message SwapLoggerRequest {
    // If provided with LoggingConfig - try to save the provided config as this preset name
    // If provided without LoggingConfig try to load an existing preset with this name
    string PresetName = 1;
    // JSON or TOML logging config
    string LoggingConfig = 2;
}

```
hi, thank you so much for helping us out! by looking at this graph, 
both projects ultimately depend on `x/net/trace`. When we load 
burrow-evm as a plugin, `init` in `trace` is called for the second 
time, which triggers a panic because the `/debug/requests` 
endpoint is registered already.

so I think it's a problem with grpc, instead of tendermint. 
(possibly `go-kit/kit` as well)
```

He also dumped their dep graph which I've attached here.

It seems if we're running a trace init in the evm itself that would be very bad for downstream libraries and we should seek to instantiate that a level ""up"" from the evm to avoid this if possible.

## Background

It is important to monitor things beyond CPU and Memory usage of a running burrow node. We want to make this as easy as possible for overloaded DevOps/SysAdmin/SRE folks by leveraging existing cloud monitoring pipelines. We should begin with Prometheus which is hugely popular, written in go, and has solid and easy to use client libraries. 

This should be a configurable feature which serves on the standard prometheus reaping port on the `/metrics` endpoint. 

## Labels

Metrics exported should label with the following values

* chain_id
* moniker

These labels will make graphing and reporting easy within grafana and other visualization tooling when multiple nodes/chains are reporting to a centralized monitoring service. 

## Mertics 

The following metrics (there could be more) should be exported

* ~block height~
* ~block time (ave, min, max over last X blocks)~
* ~transactions per block (ave, min, max over last X blocks)~
* ~current mempool depth~

""When using a client-server setup, do NOT send public keys over non-secure connections. The only time this is fine is during development when the keys are nothing but test data and does not protect anything of value. Normally they should either be kept locally and used to sign transactions locally, held on the server where the blockchain client is running, or be passed over secure channels.""

I believe what is meant here is that 'private keys' should not be sent over non-secure connections. This is also indicted by the reference to signing transactions, as private keys are used to cryptographically sign data, transactions, etc.

There is another substantive issue at LN# 520:

The HTTP method indicated for GenPrivAccount is 'GET'; this is contradicted by its elaboration at LN# 1927 where the indicated method is 'POST'.

Our ABCI app acquires the mempool lock as a signal that the commit phase has ended.

The mechanism is as follows:

The `checker` (an `executor`) contains a `StateCache`. The `checker` is passed to the ABCI `App` and also to the `Service`. In the app `CheckTx` updates the checker's state via calls to `Execute`. The checker has a RWMutex and when the checkers `state.Reader` methods are called it acquires a read lock. The write lock however is controlled externally (this allows us to block reads while we update).

The app locks the checker during commit and schedule it to be unlocked as soon as we area able to acquire a lock on tendermint's mempool. The service wraps the checker in an `Accounts` object and the `Transactor` is passed this object. When the `Transactor` tries to sign a transaction it queries the checker it has been passed to get the sequence number. If the checker is locked then this call blocks and this is how we avoid transact calls concurrent with a mempool update (which would result in us signing with a previous sequence number).

Anything that wants to read synchronised mempool state should use the checker.

It includes a number of refactorings along the way relating to transaction signing, mempool state, sequence numbers, and transaction formation, including:

- Use of `AddressableSigner` in most places `PrivateAccount` was used abstracting over key client based signing and private key signing
- Refactoring transactions to capture all signing under a single method that is added to the `Tx` interface (breaking out txs into their own files for clarity)
- Adds some additional state tests
- Factors out integration test logic and uses this to add sorely needed v0 integration tests similar to tm integration test and identically wrapped
- Adds simple benchmark for transact
- Fixes #715 ensuring transact handles recursive calls correctly
- Enables access to the mempool as a `state.AccountGetter` so that `Transactor` can optimistically assign sequence numbers as a delegated signer
- Enables address based signing via the `InputAddress` field on various of the v0 methods while maintaining backward-compatibility by keeping `PrivKey`. Both options share the same refactored `Transactor` by using the `InputAccount` abstraction.
- Ensures that a mempool backlog produced by the transactor spanning many blocks will succeed if the transactions are compatible by committing state before reseting check cache

- Reintroduces the saving and loading on startup of Burrow state to disk via go-db with blockchain and execution state stored separately but synchronised by the state root hash
- Remove poorly implemented `BlockCache` and `TxCache` in favour of a unified `StateCache` that does not access database
- Provides a separate `NameRegCache`
- Localises database access to `execution/state.go`
- Implement state writes/reads through the `account/state.go` interfaces only
- Upgrades our merkle tree to the one being maintained in https://github.com/tendermint/iavl (though not the latest version because it depends on a newer tmlibs version than the one required by our version of Tendermint)
- Provides versioned snapshots of state for every block - laying groundwork for doing something similar for events. Currently we are not exposing this versioned access
- Fixes some issues with test timings by subscribing to the account input event instead of new block


**Currently outstanding**
- Unit tests for `StateCache`, `NameRegCache`, and `State`
- StorageRoot is no longer being set on `ConcreteAccount`. We are using a single tree and a safer mechanism for database access, but we are not storing a tree per account so don't have easy access to a storage root for _each_ account. We can either scrap this, store a multitude of trees, or compute it on demand
- Upgrading to the newest IAVL tree - possibly we should depend on our own fork where we can vendor (or remove) the problematic dependencies as well as add some useful features (like the ability to store a forest of trees in the same database and load the roots).
- Deal with intermittent failure affecting `TestWSCall*` tests

`TransactAndHold` subscribes to the AccountCall event here: 

https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/develop/execution/transactor.go#L243

This waits for an AccountCall event that has a `TxHash` matching the broadcast transaction. However any nested call will also post an AccountCall event and since they are fired in post-order nested calls will be the earlier event. We need to wait for the root (externally generated) AccountCall event to be received. To do this we can attach the call depth (already tracked in the VM) to the event (and event tags) and when subscribing ensure we are at call depth 0 (the root frame).

The PR to solve this should include a test in execution_test.go that demonstrates that subscription to AccountCall can yield the wrong call event in the current implementation. We do not necessarily need to replicate at the integration test level against `TransactAndHold`

**Description**
Creating many contracts leads to high CPU load and performance problems with the chain. After stopping the chain the CPU usage drops, but then it is no longer possible to start the chain as this leads to an error ""panic: Paniced on a Sanity Check: Expected storeHeight (1867) and stateHeight (1866) to match"", which seems to be a problem with Tendermint ( see https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/388 ). There has been a fix in Tendermint (version 0.9) but this version is not used yet by monax, apparently.

There might be a relation with the following issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/611

I want to test burrow on my machine so I tried to initiate a chain with 1 root and 5 validators with:
```
monax chains make simplechain --account-types=Root:1,Validator:5 --unsafe
```

Then I tried to initiate root and validators on the same host (the seeds and service ports were modified to prevent conflicts):
 ```
monax chains start simplechain --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/simplechain/simplechain_root_000/
monax chains start simplechain --init-dir ~/.monax/chains/simplechain/simplechain_validator_000/
......
```
It failed, and i guess because monax does not allow starting chains repeatedly with the same name. 
I also tried to give a new chain name for each validator, but that would violate the definition in genesis block.

There is already everything in MockKeyClient and tendermint/go-crypto to do it: allow an entry point in config API to override default monax.keys dependency within kernel creation:

1. Make ValidatorAddress not mandatory

3. New entry in BurrowConfig that wrap Keys or new InMemoryCrypto struct
3. Support flexible API to acccess node private key in InMemoryCrypto

Example to be discussed:
```go
type BurrowConfig struct {
	// ValidatorAddress *acm.Address =>  Moved to Keys
	GenesisDoc       *genesis.GenesisDoc
	Tendermint       *tendermint.BurrowTendermintConfig

	Crypto           *CryptoConfig // New top crypto config
	RPC              *rpc.RPCConfig
	Logging          *logging_config.LoggingConfig

  - It showcases the issue of mounting a path from a VirtualBox VM into a Docker container.
  - There are two variations you should try here.
    1. Use a path in the VM that is **not** shared to the Host OS.
       - So: ``docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`/local.txt:/app/test.txt eugeneware/mmap``
    2. Use a path in the VM that **is** shared to the Host OS.
       - So: ``docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/shared/folder/local.txt:/app/test.txt eugeneware/mmap``
  - I've attempted both using the Kubernetes equivalent (a Pod) in both cases the container crashed.
    - My assumption here is that Kubernetes essentially does a ``docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/shared/folder/local.txt:/app/test.txt eugeneware/mmap`` under the hood.

### Cause
I added this cause section so it's clear what is causing the problem.

The problem seems to be a very low-level interoperability issue between VirtualBox and Docker.
Where mounting a folder which Virtualbox mounted from the Host OS is mounted using `vboxfs`.
When mounting that shared folder into a Docker container that runs LevelDB a ``illegal argument`` error is thrown.
There seem to be some indications that this is due to an inability to use `mmap` on `vboxfs`.

See this issue: https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/issues/103

#### System overview
I'll explain the system call stack with arrows so it is clear what the hierarchy is.
``Windows 10 Home -> Minikube -> VirtualBox -> Kubernetes -> Docker -> Hyperledger Burrow -> Tendermint -> LevelDB``

Shown as actions through nested bullet points.
- Windows 10: Install ``minikube`` and `kubectl`.
  - Minikube: Run ``minikube start`` and `kubectl proxy`.
  - VirtualBox: Use the ``/c/Users/`` shared folder between Windows and VirtualBox.
    - Kubernetes: Create a Pod 
      - The Pod uses a Persistent Volume (PV) with a HostPath definition set to ``/c/Users`` through a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
      - The PVC is mounted into the pod as a volume.
      - It should run Hyperledger Burrow as a container.
        - The container mounts the PVC volume to ``/home/monax/.monax``
      - Docker: Kubernetes handles mounting the ``/c/Users`` hostPath defined in the PV to ``/home/monax/.monax``
        - Hyperledger Burrow: Tries to start Tendermint as a consensus engine.
          - Tendermint: Tries to start LevelDB.
            - LevelDB: Tries to sync ``/home/monax/.monax/data/burrowmint/data/burrowmint.db``
              - This throws the ``illegal argument`` error `Panicked on a Sanity Check: Error initializing DB: sync /home/monax/.monax/data/burrowmint/data/burrowmint.db: invalid argument`

#### Shared folder usage overview
The problem is essentially caused by the filesystem used by VirtualBox to actually share the folder.

I'll explain the folder call-stack with arrows so it is clear what the hierarchy is.
``/home/monax/.monax/data/burrowmint/data/burrowmint.db/ -> /c/Users -> C:\Users\``

To illustrated further here's the same call-stack with system components.
``LevelDB (Docker) -> VirtualBox (Kubernetes Node) -> Windows 10``

The core issue lies with the mounting of a shared folder from VirtualBox into the Docker container. I.e. 
``VirtualBox (Kubernetes Node)-> LevelDB (Docker)``

The shared folder is mounted into the Docker container using ``vboxfs``. 
I.e. `/home/monax/.monax/data/burrowmint/data/burrowmint.db/ -> /c/Users `

Turns out that LevelDB has some issues with reading folders that are mounted into Docker using ``vboxfs``.

### Solution attempts
Here are the solutions I've attempted to resolve this issue.

#### Kubernetes-based
1. Simply do not use the Shared folder as a Persistent Volume (PV) to begin with.
   - I tried this but I ran into other issues. 
   - I will be exploring this further but I'm unsure whether this will resolve the core issue of VirtualBox mounting hostPaths as ``vboxfs``
1. Allow Kubernetes to dynamically provision a PV to a Persistent Volume Claim.
   - This crashes the Pod with a ``Persistent Volume Claim is not bound`` error.
1. Use a Hostpath volume instead of a Persistent Volume Claim volume.
   - Doesn't work. 
   - This crashes the Container with an error that states it cannot create a directory at ``/home/monax/.monax/data``
   - This could be due to container privileges or the ``vboxfs`` issue.
     - I might attempt running the container in privileged mode but I'm uncertain this will resolve the issue.

#### Minikube-based
1. Mount a different folder into the VirtualBox VM.
   - Not possible. 
   - An issue arises where Minikube cannot find the VM's IP causing the mount to fail: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/2072
1. Use a different Minikube driver.
   - Not possible. 
   - My host OS is Windows 10 Home. The other drivers are not available on that OS.
1. Do not use Minikube to run a Kubernets cluster locally.
   - Currently the only valid alternative to Minikube on Windows is IBM Private Cloud.
     - IBM Private Cloud also uses VirtualBox under the hood. 
     - However, it uses Vagrant to launch VirtualBox VM's. This allows one to share folders using ``nfs`` instead of `vboxfs`.
       - This is offered as a workaround in this comment: 
   - I've opened an issue with IBM Private Cloud asking how I would achieve this: https://github.com/IBM/deploy-ibm-cloud-private/issues/89

In a couple of places we previously swallowed errors that meant some issue have always been here but were not previously noticed.

It consists of three commits:
1. Some additional logging features I found I wanted when debugging (template format logging and some other serialisation cleanup)

2. Fixes and tidies up the Permissions method in client in Burrow which was dropping some fields from `PermArgs` (with corresponding changes in Bosmarmot to follow)

3. General clean up of permission checking - in particular to avoid unnecessary panics and support composite permissions checking - which I was surprised to find unsupported. Our tests seem to expect it but some swallowed errors allowed them to pass in the past.

This includes the following changes:
- Remove the restful URL interface to V0
- Drop `rpc.Result` and go-wire from the `Service` interface types and rpc/TM
- Improve the event subscriptions websocket code to make use of the JSON-RPC ID
- Drop the V0 mocked and 'scumbag' tests which were fragile and of limited usefulness
- Make use of the graceful `Shutdown(context.Context) error` supported by Go's `http.Server` since 1.8 in anticipation of replacing much of the hand-rolled server code (in particular when adding web3)
- Fixes tests for new vendored code

**Reproduction**

1) 'go test'

- checkout hypermarmot branch
- run 'go test' in 'hyperledger/burrow/execution/evm'

2) 'evm tool'

- clone ethereum/go-ethereum repo in GOPATH

- ensure $GOPATH/bin is in system PATH

- install evm: go install ./cmd/evm

- run 'evm --debug --dump --statdump -- code 620f424033557c01000000000000000000000000000

**Attempted Fix 1**

I attempted to change the badjump dest to a valid jumpdest and this led to a stack underflow

Resulting Output:

`bytecode = 620f424033557c0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

**Final Fix**

I finally altered the bytecode to place arbitrary items on the stack so as to avoid the stack underflow; however, this is more than likely not the intended outcome for the bytecode.

Resulting Output:

`bytecode = 620f424033557c0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

## Motivation and Context

For clarity in future pull-requests, the `gofmt -s` issues should be solved once and for all.

This change doesn't break the code, because it uses official `gofmt` to only do the code formatting.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/670,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/670,[Serialisation] replace go-wire with something better,"go-wire is not widely deployed or tested, not particularly idiomatic, registers types in a global variable, and generally depends on a bit too much magic (and reflection). Something like: https://github.com/ugorji/go/ looks good - well tested, multiple codecs, codegen, and a canonical flag for deterministic encodings.

go-wire does provide a 'lookup struct for interface' functionality - but this could probably be better handled by a single 'sum' envelope type: a struct with a type field/flag and pointers to each underlying type. In many cases it could be avoided altogether but needs some thought.

We use go-wire in the following places:
- `Account` serialisation in state
- `Tx` serialisation for broadcast
- `Result*` type serialisation for RPC/tm
- JSON serialisation for RPC/v0

All of these could be relatively easily replaced. Binc looks interesting: https://github.com/ugorji/binc",closed,False,2018-01-16 10:56:32,2018-06-18 12:10:10

This was shipped in Tendermint 0.9 ish. The idea being that currently any node that can connect to the network will begin syncing and be able to pull the state. However, for a lot of use cases this is not desired and what is more desired is a network setup where validators only sync with validators/fullNodes that have been authorized.

Need to investigate how this functionality is provided by Tendermint and expose it through Burrow configuration.",closed,False,2018-01-16 10:26:45,2018-10-03 13:49:42

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/666,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/666,Hypermarmot refactor,"# Refactor Summary:
For background see: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-tsc/2017-October/001163.html

About this PR:
**Note: rpc/v0 is currently out of action, I will resolve this with a future commit (possibly future PR)**

The feature/hypermarmot branch is even with develop/master apart from it containing this large commit: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/666/commits/3ba7d190c2ece6b2baefb11b7bf0064b8ea5680c that pulls in the new vendor directory on which these commits have been rebased. This is to avoid third party code that we were acquiring through glide polluting this PR.

Key themes:
- Be a better EVM/execution library; more interfaces for key data structures and clearer boundaries
- Try to be a good Tendermint App rather than fight against it
- More immutability and type safety - ask if you want a mutable type, use stronger typing, offer more specific mutations (e.g. `MutableAccount.IncSequence()`)
- Pull monax tool functionality and tests into Burrow
- Large amounts of residual cleanup dating from original split with Tendermint
- Vendor dependencies for better reproducibility of builds

## Code hygiene
- Unified `Account` notion and introduced interface to support 
- Introduce composable State interfaces
- Use appropriate unsigned types for non-negative quantities
- Default to immutable types
- Move types to where their core functionality is defined (e.g. drop core/types and other delocalisation of types)
- Dial back punning of Tendermint types - but maintain some separation between execution, serialisation, and display types (for the same logical construct) where necessary (i.e. when they may reasonably change for different reasons)
 
- Communication between `TxCache`, `BlockCache`, and `State` strictly through 'State' interfaces rather than database sharing (prepares way for Merkle tree refactor)

## Project infrastructure 
- Transitioned from Glide to Dep
- Vendored dependencies
- Upgraded all dependencies

## Technical debt
- Removed manually mapped config
- Dropped pluggable modules notion
- Removed independent module versioning
- Dropped 'Pipe' notion and lazy loading
- Removed some unnecessary layers of indirection (interfaces)

## Accounts
Replaced the following structs with interfaces to encapsulate and allow immutability:
- Account
- Validator
- PrivateAccount
- Added `Concrete*` serialisation type
- Added 20 byte `Address` type (as opposed to `[]byte`) with various conveniences

## State
- account/state interfaces provide boundary over which state is accessed uniformly
- Introduced `Blockchain`, `Tip`, and `Root` to represent 'our' side of the blockchain state - that which we track, keep synchronised, and use in execution

## Execution
- `BatchExecutor` and `BatchCommitter` wrap `BlockCache` preparing for improved implementation
- `TxEncoder` and `TxDecoder` introduced to make possible to migrate to different binary encoding

## RPC
- Introduce central unified service.go
- Serialisation of `Result` via go-wire data mapper

### tm
- Rename to 'tm' in an effort to forget its origins and avoid confusion with our consensus engine/modules

## Tendermint
- Upgraded to 0.12.0 (and counting)
- Provided read-only view of node
- Implemented monax-keys interface backed PrivValidator (having requested change in Tendermint)
- Provide GenesisDoc in memory - derived from our GenesisDoc rather than passing around file
- Stopped exposing all possible config - will expose the bare minimum and coordinate those values

## Genesis
- `GenesisSpec` provides genesis templating and `monax chains make` type functionality, e.g.
```shell
# Chain one-liner to create keys according to spec, formulate GenesisDoc and config
burrow spec --participant-accounts 2 --full-accounts 1 | burrow configure --genesis-spec=- --validator-index 0 | burrow -c-
```
- Burrow -> TM genesis closed in via AppHash
- Genesis account types made compatible and convertible to/from `Account`/`PrivateAccount`

## Config
- Mapped automatically to/from `BurrowConfig` struct
- sources package providers ability to chain `ConfigProviders` (e.g. environment, file, XDG) together, to use a single file, split across multiple, or read directly from stdin.

## Events
- Serialisation via go-wire data mapper
- Introduce `AnyEventData` sum type
- Separate EVM and execution events
- Fixed empty cache bug

## Tx
- Serialise via data-mapper

## Serialisation
- Drop unnecessary tags and support TOML/JSON

The install process laid out in https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow#for-developers is slightly outdated. I have found this to be true at least in repeated observation that the go-clist package no longer exists in the github.com/tendermint/tendermint repository. A lot of the packages that were present here have been migrated to github.com/tendermint/tmlibs/ as the tendermint project has matured.

**Side note:**
Also, note that the workaround in ( https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/issues/675 ) recommends setting global git config via command line with:
`git config --global url.""git@github.com:"".insteadOf ""https://github.com/""`

This avoids the authentication catch, but does not fix the problem.

**Propose Fix:**
A pull request on this issue to develop that updates glide.lock and glide.yaml that points to new tendermint/tmlibs repo. This does not entierly fix the problem because the tendermint version currently used is ~0.9.2, while the migration occurred at a later version closer to ~0.12.1 I believe.

**Please note the commits prefixed with `WIP:` will be rebased in the future, you may need to force pull in the future**

**This PR is offensively large, but I promise it is roughly 2/3 renames, comments, and tests**

For background see: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-tsc/2017-October/001163.html 

Key themes:
- Be a better EVM/execution library; more interfaces for key data structures and clearer boundaries
- Try to be a good Tendermint App rather than fight against it
- More immutability and type safety - ask if you want a mutable type, use stronger typing, offer more specific mutations (e.g. `MutableAccount.IncSequence()`)
- Pull monax tool functionality and tests into Burrow
- Large amounts of residual cleanup dating from original split with Tendermint

## Code hygiene
- Unified `Account` notion and introduced interface to support 
- Introduce composable State interfaces
- Use appropriate unsigned types for non-negative quantities
- Default to immutable types
- Move types to where their core functionality is defined (e.g. drop core/types and other delocalisation of types)
- Dial back punning of Tendermint types - but maintain some separation between execution, serialisation, and display types (for the same logical construct) where necessary (i.e. when they may reasonably change for different reasons)
 
- Communication between `TxCache`, `BlockCache`, and `State` strictly through 'State' interfaces rather than database sharing (prepares way for Merkle tree refactor)

## Project infrastructure 
- Transitioned from Glide to Dep
- Vendored dependencies
- Upgraded all dependencies

## Technical debt
- Removed manually mapped config
- Dropped pluggable modules notion
- Removed independent module versioning
- Dropped 'Pipe' notion and lazy loading
- Removed some unnecessary layers of indirection (interfaces)

## Accounts
Replaced the following structs with interfaces to encapsulate and allow immutability:
- Account
- Validator
- PrivateAccount
- Added `Concrete*` serialisation type
- Added 20 byte `Address` type (as opposed to `[]byte`) with various conveniences

## State
- account/state interfaces provide boundary over which state is accessed uniformly
- Introduced `Blockchain`, `Tip`, and `Root` to represent 'our' side of the blockchain state - that which we track, keep synchronised, and use in execution

## Execution
- `BatchExecutor` and `BatchCommitter` wrap `BlockCache` preparing for improved implementation
- `TxEncoder` and `TxDecoder` introduced to make possible to migrate to different binary encoding

## RPC
- Introduce central unified service.go
- Serialisation of `Result` via go-wire data mapper

### tm
- Rename to 'tm' in an effort to forget its origins and avoid confusion with our consensus engine/modules

## Tendermint
- Upgraded to 0.12.0 (and counting)
- Provided read-only view of node
- Implemented monax-keys interface backed PrivValidator (having requested change in Tendermint)
- Provide GenesisDoc in memory - derived from our GenesisDoc rather than passing around file
- Stopped exposing all possible config - will expose the bare minimum and coordinate those values

## Genesis
- `GenesisSpec` provides genesis templating and `monax chains make` type functionality, e.g.
```shell
# Chain one-liner to create keys according to spec, formulate GenesisDoc and config
burrow spec --participant-accounts 2 --full-accounts 1 | burrow configure --genesis-spec=- --validator-index 0 | burrow -c-
```
- Burrow -> TM genesis closed in via AppHash
- Genesis account types made compatible and convertible to/from `Account`/`PrivateAccount`

## Config
- Mapped automatically to/from `BurrowConfig` struct
- sources package providers ability to chain `ConfigProviders` (e.g. environment, file, XDG) together, to use a single file, split across multiple, or read directly from stdin.

## Events
- Serialisation via go-wire data mapper
- Introduce `AnyEventData` sum type
- Separate EVM and execution events
- Fixed empty cache bug

## Tx
- Serialise via data-mapper

## Serialisation
- Drop unnecessary tags and support TOML/JSON",closed,True,2017-11-23 15:56:09,2018-01-30 22:00:18

We have been trying to install Burrow following the instructions, but have been unable to do so.

Details as follows:

We are running Ubuntu 16.04.3
Monax CLI Version: 0.16.0
go version go1.6.2 linux/amd64

Following the install instructions and running the following from the command line:

go get -d github.com/hyperledger/burrow

We get the following error:
""can't load package: package github.com/hyperledger/burrow: no buildable Go source files in /root/.go/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow""

Not to be totally thrown by this we did try installing by hand by going to:
/.go/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow/cmd  (where .go is our $GOPATH) and running go install from there however, this threw up a list of packages which were missing (tendermint related etc). SO we went through and installed each of these individually except one which wouldn't install - namely:

So I did some digging before I dropped an issue here. I found an issue (where I also commented) https://github.com/google/leveldb/issues/281 which describes the same issue.
It might have something to do with the fact that Docker Quickstart Terminal uses shared folders for volumes on Windows.

Maybe @silasdavis could tell me how he tested the container? That would be great.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/644,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/644,Upgrade our CI/CD process,"Initially motivated by wanting to upgrade our images to use alpine 3.6 I have streamlined and improved the build process in the following ways:

- Upgraded our base image to alpine 3.6 and go 1.9.0
- Upgraded to CircleCI 2.0 (mostly to get access to docker >= 17.05, but this will be the version they support going forward)
- Changed our two-step build process + script to a single multistage build (this gives us the same small build image without juggling artefacts
- Dropped out dependence on Monax build and base images (defined in https://github.com/monax/monax). We now just depend on our own Dockerfile and a well maintained external images, so it should be easier to upgrade and get security fixes. 
- Enhanced our immutability guarantees around released images by:
  - Not pushing a release unless code version and tag version match
  - Pushing a separate `db-dev-${time}-${commit}` images from develop to avoid accidentally depending on a 'mutable pre-release'

Note that in order to get branch and tag filtering on CircleCI 2.0 I had to use their 'workflow' feature. We could potentially use this for other things, but frankly it was a bit of a pain to get it to do something as obvious as this setup is. Still it's nice to watch the workflow graph when it works...

I have been testing and iterating the circle process on my own fork. A commit to develop will trigger a build like this:
https://circleci.com/workflow-run/02e47d4f-dac1-4380-bce0-07d794e52f99

A tag is similar, but the build tool would tag it with the version in version.go (provided it the tag version matches).

Any other commit just tests:

- Only pushes to quay.io from a tagged version or from develop
- Adds the commit and date to the docker label if building from a commit that is not tagged like a version (e.g. v0.17.0)

So:

- tagged commits should build and push to: `quay.io/monax/db:0.17.0`
- later on, commits to develop will push to `quay.io/monax/db:0.17.0-dev-20172408-c4c4651` (and so on...)

This means we can drop the idea of a 'mutable docker image for pre-release versions' which has been problematic.

burrow,ratranqu,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/627,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/627,Panic in SLOAD when trying to access contract storage,"Please include in your bug report:

- [ ] `burrow version` (docker image tag or branch if built from source)
develop

- [ ] steps to reproduction
` burrow serve --work-dir ~/decpub/single -d`

In this case, `burrow` recovers however, the storage is somewhat corrupted as it is requesting for a key that it can't find.

- [ Master branch, commit 61a1bb2781bac614d5c467430483706e89ff9456 ] `burrow version` (docker image tag or branch if built from source)
- [ N/A ] `monax version` (if applicable)

- [ N/A ] `docker version` (if applicable)
- [ Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS ] operating system details (osx/windows/linux)
- [  ] what you expected to happen

Running `glide update` should refresh the `glide.lock` file and produce a set of dependencies that Burrow can build against. This is necessary if one wants to build Burrow against forked versions of dependencies (e.g. to test new features). 

- [  ] what actually happened

The `glide update` command produced an error:

> Error scanning github.com/tendermint/abci/example/nil: open /home/ubuntu/.glide/cache/src/https-github.com-tendermint-abci/example/nil: no such file or directory.
> This error means the referenced package was not found. Missing file or directory errors usually occur when multiple packages share a common dependency and the first reference encountered by the scanner sets the version to one that does not contain a subpackage needed required by another package that uses the shared dependency. Try setting a version in your glide.yaml that works for all packages that share this dependency.

A few days ago, the `update` command completed successfully, however Burrow would not compile against the set of dependencies that were downloaded. Looking at the commit history, it looks like the `glide.lock` file has seen some hand-edits, so perhaps the YAML file is outdated?

- [  ] steps to reproduction

burrow,marc4gov,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/615,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/615,chain is unstable - stopping and starting 1 validator makes the validator trip,"Please include in your bug report:

- [ 0.16.4] `burrow version` (docker image tag or branch if built from source)
- [0.16 ] `monax version` (if applicable)
- [1.8 ] `go version` (if applicable)
- [17.05 ] `docker version` (if applicable)
- [ linux] operating system details (osx/windows/linux)
- [ ] what you expected to happen
Stopping and starting 1 validator out of 4 should not be a problem
- [ ] what actually happened
Chain seems to keep running, but I can't get the stopped validator back on
- [ ] steps to reproduction
I have 4 validators in 1 datacenter stopping 1 validator and starting it again gives this:

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/613,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/613,Step back from the notion of two independent logging channels,"When I first implemented the logger I wanted to encourage a high frequency of log messages to the trace channel with impunity. To do this their are two independent language-level channels in InfoTraceLogger. It seemed like a good idea at the time. But in fact it introduces a fair bit of accidental complexity and some odd corner cases (since you want Info and Trace messages to be strictly ordered and interlaced you need to send Info messages to both the Info and Trace output loggers, which then obscures the intent of the sender... it ends up a bit confused).

The desired effect can be achieved in a simpler way with sinks (just filter trace messages), and I will be introducing logging presets (that is preset LoggingConfigs, because it's too much to ask people to write these from scratch for common cases) which will make it even easier.

So putting this down to experience I've decided it was optimising the wrong thing, and too early. So I have:

- Kept the same InfoTraceLogger type definition and semantics (more or less)
- Simplified InfoTraceLogger to take single output logger (which makes InfoTraceLogger a simple wrapper on top of go-kit/log/logger)
- Upgraded to latest go-kit/log which makes a minor improvements (Tendermint are also basing their logging component around go-kit/log)

Non-blocking logging is maintained, which i still thing is a good idea.

Logging presets will follow this, which I hope to be the last 'user friendliness' element that is missing from the logging component. Once we are on Tendermint 0.10.0 we can also provide a better logging capturing experience for Tendermint logs. ",closed,True,2017-05-21 17:09:56,2017-06-02 14:32:12

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/607,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/607,Implement dynamic memory and fix out of bounds issues,"This PR introduces a dynamic memory implementation that satisfies the assumption (by Solidity) that memory will be dynamically allocated at the memory boundary when an `MSTORE` writes to the memory boundary provided by `MSIZE`.

The Solidity compiler assumes that memory will be dynamically allocated at the current memory upper bounds (as reported by `MSIZE`) if an `MSTORE` operation tries to write to it. I believe the reason for this behaviour is that it is an easy way to guarantee that a portion a of memory will be unused (since it has not yet been allocated). Obviously this only works if the EVM environment will dynamically allocate that memory for you. This PR implements this in Burrow.

For reference, the Solidity assumption around object creation is encoded in the Solidity compiler here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L842-L851

And you can see the dynamic memory allocation in go-ethereum here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/interpreter.go#L152-L173 . Where the memory size is just the mstore offset + one word calculated here: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/memory_table.go#L49-L51.

I have taken a simpler approach of growing the memory on a `Write` operation up to a configurable bounds. I make use of the underlying slice implementation in Go to efficiently grow arrays. This PR includes:

- Simple `Memory` interface to encapsulate memory operations
- Adds a `memoryProvider` argument to `NewVM`
- Switches out memory slice for new `Memory` object 
- Fixes issues arising because the `subslice` function simply wasn't fit for purpose
- Adds a variety of tests, including on in the VM to test for the specific 'allocation on boundary' behaviour Solidity expects.

This line in `BlockCache`.Sync is reached: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/manager/burrow-mint/state/block_cache.go#L227 when Burrow attempts to remove an account from the merkle IAVL tree when it has already been removed. This happens one block after the block that _did_ successfully remove the account because the `BlockCache` holds an 'append only' cache of account and storage changes: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/blob/master/manager/burrow-mint/state/block_cache.go#L41-L42. It stores an account removal by setting a 'removed' flag so the account object becomes a tombstone object. But the `Sync` method does not clean up these objects so on the subsequent block it attempts to remove an account that has already been removed.

I'd like to think a bit more about where else we may be having a stale cache and see if there is a reasonable way to test the Sync method if that can be added in reasonably timely fashion.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/596,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/596,Remove module versioning,"In the process of doing the Tendermint upgrade I came up against the slightly cumbersome process for updating our versioning. Since the upgrade touched this I have tried to address it here. I understand the legitimate motivations for the independent versioning of modules (from Burrow itself), and I am happy to rollback changes if this really goes too far. However I put forward the following arguments/principles that guided my work:

Burrow should continue to support the idea of 'modules' (consensus and manager), however it is down to a point release (that is specific compiled binary) of Burrow to ensure that the modules it bundles are compatible (with respect to versions). We do this through dependency management and versioning and therefore it is redundant to further assert on the versions of our modules. In reality it is not clear at all how we could support multiple versions of 'the same' manager. If we would like to support different compatibility-level versions of a manager or consensus engine then it is sufficient to give them separate names. For the purposes of Burrow's initialisation it does not need to know they they belong to the same lineage.

To determine compatibility between modules we should try and make use of the type system rather than hand-coded values (that we have to robotically have to upgrade in multiple places). We can extend the current 'dependency injection' of ConsensusEngine to help us with this. When a consensus module is loaded into a 'manager Pipe' (we load Manager first so we may as well consider the pipe to be manager-typed at that point) we can ask ConsensusEngine and Manager/Application to check Pipe for compatible implementations by trying to type convert interfaces: _, ok := pipe.ConsensusEngine.(BurrowMintCompatibleConsensusEngine). We can capture the actual functional requirements that a module may have by using this pattern. If we really need to be version specific (i.e. we have compatible interface signatures that belonging to logically incompatible versions) we can add a marker function func BurrowMint_0_18_4_Consensus() that captures that incompatible, but we can do so when we really need it rather than pre-emptively.

It is useful to error on being provided a configuration written by a different version of Burrow to the runtime version of Burrow. To do this we can continue to close the Burrow version into the generated config file. But as in 1 it is sufficient to just use the single over-arching version number.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/560,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/560,Remove/simplify unused plumbing intended for swappable modules (consensus/execution),"Currently we have the notion of a manager (execution engine + state) and consensus. These are good boundaries in terms of design and layout (although I would like to improve on what we have: https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/291).

We also have a lot of code that anticipates the possibility of mixing different consensus engines with different managers and arbitrary compatibility between them. So we have a root aggregate version/version.go. We have assertions around compatible consensus, and we have values in the config that have to match up appropriately. All of this buys us nothing other than a headache when bumping the version that has to be altered in several versions.

All of this made more sense when we envisaged a microservice architecture with each of our modules running in separate processes across a network, but I propose that we attempt to remove much of it and simplify the boot process of Burrow. We should keep (in fact we should strengthen) the logical engineering boundaries, but we should drop versions checks/assertions and assume that a release contains compatible versions of dependencies.

Another feature that I now find overly generic is modelling consensus and managers via a generic `ModuleConfig` with the attendant general 'module' loading code which also ties in with the versioning stuff. I think it would be clearer to have a specific `ConsensusConfig` and remove a few layers of indirection. Every time I bump a version I find this code confusing to follow and with our present direction I feel it adds nothing.

I'm making a call to Solidity selfdestruct via a cascading contract call, e.g.:

From a TaskManager contract:
```
    function removeTask(address manager, address taskAddress)
    returns (bool result) {
        Task t = Task(taskAddress);
        if (t.remove(manager)) {
            taskList.removeElement(t);
            TaskDeleted(t, ""Task Deleted"", block.number, block.timestamp);
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
```
call from within the Task contract:

```
    function remove(address manager)
    onlyManager(manager)
    isEmpty(manager)
    returns (bool)
    {
        selfdestruct(owner);
        return true;
    }
```
It doesn't matter if I use the `owner` or the `manager` address for the refund

I am trying to use the getBlocks() through RPC, the same code was used for getBlock with params: {height : 4271618} and it worked. 

But when I do getBlocks with the below: - 
---------------------------------
var getBlocks_option = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'http://ipaddress/rpc',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json'

        op: "">"",
        value : ""4271618""}
    },
    json: true
  };
---------------------------------
The return is the most recent 50 blocks, and does not take into account for the params specified, in fact, I can pass an undefined value and the same is returned. This was sent via node request lib

But if I do :-
---------------------------------
http://ipaddress/blockchain/blocks?q=height:>4271618

The correct result is returned.

The addition of the `DecodeBytesPtr` was unnecessary since go-wire will do the delegate to the correct function anyway.

To respond to @ratranqu, who said (in the PR linked above):

>It's a bit more than just a change from always assuming a CallTx to handling any types of Tx. The json representation of the asummed CallTx is also not consistent with how it's expected in the wire protocol (see txs/tx.go file, where the concrete type is defined for the wire protocol).

The reason this change should correct the expected formatting (even for a `CallTx`) is because the type byte is part of the default serialisation when we are decoding into a registered interface (as we are now with `tx.Tx`) but is not when decoding into a specific struct (as we were before with `&tx.CallTx`). 

I note that the `JsonRpcServer` methods are untested, and have always been. Still it feels a bit unpleasant to include this without a test. It should be possible to use `./test/mock` to put something together so I mark this as don't merge. (Incidentally `mock_web_api_test.go` really ought to be `rpc/v0/restServer_test.go`)...",closed,True,2017-02-25 00:04:46,2017-02-27 19:50:07

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/500,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/500,Introduce more strongly typed SNatives and contract templates,"This PR aims to address the issue of having many versions of the permissions contract in different places. Since eris-db is responsible for interpreting SNative calls it seems sensible that eris-db holds the defintion for SNatives. This PR:

- Introduces a more strongly typed (the functions themselves are still not strongly typed) SNative and contract definition
- Allows you to generate a permissions contract with comments that compiles and can be exported to other projects like smart contract bundles
- Adds a test for the permissions contract

It doesn't change the fundamentals of how SNatives work.

The permissions contract structure is built from the libraries' team's version: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-contract-bundles/blob/master/src/commons-auth/contracts/SecureNativeAuthorizations.sol which Jason linked me too which is nicely commented.

Outstanding for this is:
- [x] Finalise what types we are going to use for the permissions function
- [x] Possibly take opportunity to change the naming conventions as in https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/issues/417
- [x] Add a couple more unit tests

Once that is done then we can mechanical generate the solidity interface that we are advertising to clients and we can do this for any future SNatives (which is why I thought it was worth doing). By running:

```go
vm.SNativeContracts()[""permissions_contract""].Solidity()
```

Also note that the current version of snative.go on release-0.16 is missing a bracket in the signature.

But please get all `.` imports out of the code.

Hi @somak12 thanks for the bug report. We've seen similar behaviour pop up recently. Can you provide more details on how you created/started your chain? pinging @benjaminbollen for review of eris-db logs

@somak12 commented on [Thu Dec 15 2016](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cli/issues/1138#issuecomment-267243164)

@zramsay I created chain with 1 root account + 4 participants + 3 validators. Im using docker machines(amazon driver) for the validators. As you can see things were working fine till height 82510. One thing is that after work I used to stop the chain and the eris service and restart it back when needed.

And Im uisng image = ""quay.io/eris/db:0.12.1"" for issue of chain not creating blocks due to use of curent timestamp in the contract..

I am having exactly the same issue. tried to leave a chain running over the weekend to test how big it would get and returned to find this message in the logs. Cleaning Eris and restarting the chains does nothing for me - still get `Found conflicting vote from ourselves. Did you unsafe_reset a validator?` in the logs.

Look like I have something similar. I start 4 validators, that's ok. Then I start the root machine, looks like the chain is running (Height is increasing) but actually not making blocks. Logs shows messages like these:

```

after several restarts, the chain is finally catching up (with WARN signals, but that's because it has to sync I guess), but looks unstable. Deploying contracts is going OK, but later on, the chain stops and I get the same message as Andy and somak12 are getting. At that point I just can't manage the chain getting up again for the root machine.

The validators seem Ok though. This is my setup:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo ""Running HerenBouwChain environment setup...""
chainName=herenbouwchain

for i in `seq 0 3`
do
  eris chains rm -xf $chainName --machine ""do-val$i""
  eris chains start --init-dir ""${chainName}""/""${chainName}_validator_00$i"" --machine ""do-val$i"" $chainName
  echo ""Wait for do-val$i to start $chainName..""
done

eris chains rm -xf $chainName --machine do-prod0
eris chains start --init-dir ""${chainName}""/""${chainName}_root_000"" --machine do-prod0 $chainName
echo ""Wait for do-prod0 to start $chainName..""

The main thing missing at this stage is configuration which will be a subsequent pull request. Otherwise the logging works fine and people can base off this.

However glide does provide most of what we need. This is an effort to solve a common use face while we wait for glide to integrate the more full-featured GPS library (which should allow our use cases).

Hell allows you to upgrade a package using glide and simply absorb that package's glide.lock file into your own (as well as upgrading glide.yaml for future use).

It does what we wish `glide get` would (for our case). That is, it leaves all other dependencies alone and just pulls in first-level transitive dependencies specified in a dependency's glide.lock file.

The usage is something like:

`go run ./hell/cmd/hell/main.go get --interactive github.com/tendermint/tendermint`                     

This will use glide as library to get a version of tendermint (you can choose the release) and then tendermint's glide.lock into our own. This way we obtain the transitive dependencies that any glide-using project has specified.

It's a bit of a blunt instrument in that it will just overwrite conflicting dependencies. But most of the time this is what we want. It should tide us over until principled full-featured package management/conflict resolution lands in glide.",closed,True,2017-01-25 14:08:07,2017-03-14 18:16:12

The chain becomes unusable and cannot be recovered. E.g. stopping and starting the chain node does not eradicate the JSON unmarshal error.

#### Requirements:
Even though the problem is due to a programming error in solidity, the timeout of the operation should not render the chain useless. This should be analyzed to find a way to allow contracts to fail in this way and still leave the chain in a usable state.

Facing the same issue when using http instead of rpc. **Eventpoll** and **EventUnubscribe** does not work in latest eris-db version.
I did a POST request: 
```

burrow,compleatang,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/437,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/437,[Discuss] Log Events to segment.io,"### Problem

Currently it is exorbitantly expensive to maintain the analytics surface area most blockchains are trying to manage. Blockchain clients maintain an entire (bespoke) RPC system, then a client library to that RPC. 

On top of that consumers of blockchain clients currently expect to be able to interact with the data produced in that blockchain in a very large number of ways (due to the wide variety of use cases currently being built on eris:db). 

This, in turn, requires that we maintain libraries like eris-sqlsol an ETL layer which pipes event and collection based data from the chain into a queriable database. 

In the future as our user's systems increase in size and complexity the ETL costs are going to rise dramatically. We need to have a cleaner way of scaling here without having to build all of it ourselves. 

### Solution

Stop trying to build an ETL layer on top of everything else; rather bake in a stronger connection to an industry leading analytics aggregator and use their very connected ETL layer. Such a change will enable customers to route data into systems they already use to analyze business data (or, at a dead minimum, a simple postgres database on premise or wherever they'd like it).

[Segment](https://segment.io) is an advanced data warehousing and integration platform. It is used by many applications to log and coordinate a number of different [touch points](https://segment.com/catalog#integrations/all) their business may have. By utilizing an [API like segment's](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-go) we enable our users to do a whole range of interesting things. 

Examples of what this would enable

* new item added to the collections manager on this chain? send a message to slack -> https://segment.com/integrations/slack
* new business added to ""my collection"" on LEI chain? identify them with enriched data from Clearbit -> https://segment.com/integrations/clearbit ... and send them to SalesForce -> https://segment.com/integrations/salesforce
* application makers want to automatically report exceptions thrown by their smart contract suite -> https://segment.com/integrations/bugsnag
* application makers want to enable push notifications from specific events on their chain -> https://segment.com/integrations/kahuna
* forget monax having to build a blockchain explorer... just use keen.io -> https://segment.com/integrations/keen-io ... or tableau -> http://www.tableau.com/ ... or a range of other analytics tooling.

Because segment.io takes much of the ETL trouble out, and solely warehouses back to warehouses controlled by the customer, it would be much more useful just to integrate with a service like them than to have to build our own ETL layer. 

### What to log?

By default: blocks and transactions
By selection: a json file similar in schema to what sqlsol uses that defines: 

* contract events to listen for (these would, theoretically map to [this](https://segment.com/docs/sources/server/go/#track))
* contract collections to listen for (where collections meet a specification we should be able to register default CRUD functions)

### Notes

In theory this would play nicely with how @silasdavis has designed and built the logging system. 

In a first run should we add the feature, exposing all blocks and transactions would comport with what Ben and Tyler agreed would be needed to do sqlsol better anyway. 

This would be a very low cost way to increase what users can do with their chains dramatically. 

This would be a feature that (I suspect) would typically be turned on via flag or env var rather than written in a config file. 

There are a variety of analytics systems that ETL & route, but segment is what we're using for our internal systems; and from all my research is the most centrally placed so as to give us the most benefit for the least cost.",closed,False,2017-01-08 16:20:18,2017-01-11 00:22:21

* Query all the contracts every time you want to synchronize
or
* Have a subscriber for each event of each contract to gather the info when it is produced.

Those approaches have several problems.
The first one overloads eris and takes to much time.
The second one can miss an event if a subscriber dies(or you must have multiple subscribers) and need a huge amount of subscribers to get all the events.

Two possible ways to have a more useful way to gather all this events are:

* Send all the events produced on a node to a preconfigured endpoint(for example en the config.toml). This endpoint will gather all the events, no matter the origin contract or the type of the event, for a latter processing of all them. i.e. a bigdata processing. One advantage of this approach is that a node unbounds and latter bound again all the events are going to be sent again(timestamped with the block number).

* Have a queue on each node where the events produced are stored (if enabled on the config.toml) until are read from an external program. Same advantage as previous one.

This improvements will make way easier have an approximated vision of the network for the exploitation of the data without overloading eris with queries or having tons of subscribers. i.e. stock of all products on a supply chain.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/pull/421,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/421,Logging for preliminary review,"This WIP PR included the framework of the logging system I have written so far to implement ideas from https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/pull/421. It also includes some changes that seemed apt to make as I introduce a non-global logger at the root level.

Guide to changes:

#### Housekeeping
- Convert global vars (like `do *definition.Do` and loggers) into functional dependencies:
  - better for testing
  - less action at a distance
- Safely wrapped Viper's subconfig
- Bit of gofmt and imports

#### Logging
- Opted for to use [go-kit log](https://github.com/go-kit/kit/tree/master/log) as the underlying interface (see below for discussion)
- Opted to support log15 both on input and output (to make use of its handlers)
- Introduced `InfoTraceLogger` as the main binary interface (choose just one level/channel) for our logging. Each channel can be routed separately
- Used `ChannelLogger` to have a non-blocking non-overflowing never-stop-the-caller execution
- Introduced `MultipleChannelLogger` and `MultipleOutputLogger` allowing composing of loggers roughly under 'OR' / 'AND' logic respectively. These will will allow for setting up arbitrary numbers of logging sinks (remote servers, syslog, stderr, files, etc).

####  go-kit log and log15
After various drafts of logging and flip-flopping between just using log15's interface as our main interface and wrapping it and just go-kit log I have opted for something of a mash-up between go-kit log and log15. Although I would argue (having read up quite a bit on the design intentions of go-kit log) that I am using go-kit log as intended: in that it is designed to be wrapped and composed. In some ways you might see go-kit log as a logging facade rather like slf4j (in Java land), but simpler.

go-kit is a thematically related collection of packages designed for 'microservice architectures'. You don't have to care about that in order for it to be relevant. But it is based around a generic structured logging interface `Log (keyvals... interface{}) error`. This is very similar to log15's handler, but by making it the single interface everything is built around it encourages logging to behave has a composable pipeline with a somewhat flexible, but structured, schema, that you can wrap for consumption (which is what `InfoTraceLogger` does). They also model `Context` as a struct that wraps a logger rather than a field within a `Record` as log15 does. This means that contexts are established external to loggers/records and that there are no 'preferred fields'.

My feeling is that this suits how we should come to think about logs: as data in their own right that drives other things. I also think that this kind of machinery might be a better way to think about events in general, though it needn't be.

I was also keen not to have too many log levels, because I think they rely on that a shared hierarchy exists between the mind of the log line emitter and the mind of log line consumer that does not generally exist. I also think that `Critical`, `Error`, and `Fatal` are somewhat misnomers: in that if you are logging something then by definition you have handled any error (this might be appropriate in other settings, but for us as a fault tolerant system I think most things should not be fatal). However it does seem useful to have a 'noisy' and a 'quiet' channel for logs, which I have designated as 'Trace' and 'Info' respectively. I prefer 'trace' from 'debug' because I like that it doesn't try to suggest the noisy log channel is only good for debugging, in fact it might be used to drive other systems. It would have be hard to wrap log15 to provide this interface.

However, since log15 has lots of nice handlers and since Tendermint uses log15 (their very slightly different fork) I have written an adapter that allows us to capture log15 logging and also allows use to use log15 handlers. I think this kind of wrapping is in the spirit of go-kit log, but wouldn't really be the other way around.",closed,True,2016-12-12 17:19:29,2016-12-15 11:50:22

The 'intentional verbosity' or rather log line type is covered by 'log level' below.
- Log level, at least: Info, Debug, probably: Warning, Error/Fault (some say that if you have logged an error then you have handled it and by definition it is not an error, this is semantics, but it seems that we have faults as in (B)FT that are interesting enough to have their own level but not strictly exceptional)

We should:

- Either close or label every open issue
- Label every issue with a severity (triage)
- Label every issue with type (bug, feature, etc)
- Label every issue with which component is affected
- Label as 'ready to work on' or 'needs more information'

I'd also like to raise the standard of issue reporting without being obstructive by:
- Asking for clear reproduction steps
- Urging strongly for the reporter to provide a minimal test case/example that is as focused as possible, and probably built specifically for the issue (not always practical, and sometimes will be down to issue investigator, but often the reporter could do more than they tend to do currently)

This pushes a certain amount of work onto the reporter, but we have limited resources and often the reporter can do more particularly around generic work isolating where the bug appears. We are always grateful to have issues reported, but we should (usually) prioritise issues with clear isolated reproduction above those without, since it is a more efficient use of our time and there is a self-selection at work on the priorities of the reporter - presumably if someone has made more effort in the reporting of a bug they assign more value to it themselves.

I'd like to also propose for non-critical issues that have limited or inadequate reproduction steps, that we first label them and request more information, but if they are dormant for ~3 months we close them.

> EventPoll is used to get all the events that has accumulated since the last time the subscription was polled. It takes the subscription ID as a parameter. NOTE: This only works over HTTP. Websocket connections will automatically receive events as they happen. They are sent as regular JSON-RPC 2.0 responses with the subscriber ID as response id.

From the [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object):

> id
> This member is REQUIRED.
> It MUST be the same as the value of the id member in the Request Object.

Using the response id member to push event notifications is a violation of the JSON-RPC specification and a perversion of its intent (remote procedure calling).

Instead, Eris DB should stay compliant by using the callback paradigm to send a JSON-RPC Request object to the client:

``` JSON
{
  ""method"": ""event"",

| Problem number | Name | Solution outline |
|----------------|------|------------------|
| 1 | Log format | All logging from eris-db should pass through the same (outer) logging library and code path, including logs from dependencies/components. Component logs will be subject to some mapping or embedding within our format. All logging should use a consistent structured format which will be based on something like the Graylog Extensible Log Format (GELF) allowing it to be shipped.|
| 2 | Log structure | Structure logs with consistent metadata including parent context for logs from eris-db components (for example, `[module: rpc/v0, method: broadcast_tx, chain_state: fast_syncing] invalid HEX encoding`, rather than `invalid HEX encoding`).|
| 3 | Log capture | For each dependency we need to centralise the log level, and ideally configure an output adapter that routes through our logging library. This may need a custom component for each different logging library. In the case of dependencies that use a single globabl instance of the go Logger we should use `SetOutput` to capture the output to an io.Writer. |
| 4 | Log output | We should support the at least following logging sinks: stdout, named pipe, files, syslog, and graylog. With a plugin architecture for different sinks (and we will consider fluentd). Each enabled sink will support independent log levels, and where applicable (e.g. for graylog, but not stdout) multiple instances of a logging sink may be configured. |
| 5 | Log volume | We should agree on a standard set and intepretation of log levels and apply this standard to code that we own. For third-party code we should map between a log level set globally and set that level for dependencies. It may make sense to allow the setting of log level per module or hierarchical identifier (see [Log correlation identifiers](#design-ideas)), third party libraries could have all of their logging segregated by such a top-level identifier. We should also allow for the customisation of automatically appended metadata such as datetime format, hostname, log line origin (in source) and verbosity presets can be established for these. |

To get compatibility between all Ethereum clients we worked out a spec for a common key file: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition

While GCM is nice and we probably should have gone with it instead of CTR + MAC, for the moment Ethereum clients generate key files with CTR.

However the current go-ethereum code supports multiple key formats for backwards compatibility; both scrypt and PBKDF2 for KDF and both CTR and CBC for encryption mode. This could be extended to support GCM if defined by the `cipher` field present in version 3 (latest) of the spec.

Would recommend we strive for compatibility between platforms here. This could be done quite easily if eris-keys rebases on go-ethereum's `crypto/key_store_passphrase.go` to pickup version 3 of it's key file format and defines it's GCM mode usage by setting the  `cipher` field to something like `aes-128-gcm` (we use `aes-128-ctr` to denote CTR mode)

Looks like this function was picked up when forking old go-ethereum code: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-keys/blob/master/crypto/randentropy/rand_entropy.go#L32

This function was merely intended as an experiment and to discuss merits of XORing in additional sources onto the OS CSPRNG. It was not intended for production use and has since been removed from the code base since we decided the extra complexity and risks that come with it was not worth potential benefits of additional sources in case the OS source through `crypto/rand` is weak.

Would recommend switching to using plain `crypto/rand` helpers currently used in go-ethereum (these where covered by Ethereum's security audits) : https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/crypto/randentropy/rand_entropy.go

@ebuchman commented on [Wed Sep 09 2015](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-keys/issues/23#issuecomment-138912523)

yup I was following this discussion in go-ethereum. is XORing in this kind of information not a standard practice? were actual risks identified? or was it just ""better not add more complexity""? I figured I'd keep it at least as a talking point until I had a better idea why it was removed. Seems like if the host OS generator is compromised (as we've seen it has been a few times), this could be a life saviour.

---

@Gustav-Simonsson commented on [Wed Sep 09 2015](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-keys/issues/23#issuecomment-138993881)

Actual, concrete risks where not identified. It was more ""better not add more complexity"". And yes, if the OS source is compromised it could in theory still achieve enough entropy since it's combined with a hard KDF. Was thinking especially of the issue on android with it's bitcoin wallet.

It was mostly informal discussions though, and most people thought the extra complexity was not worth the potential upside in that case.

I still haven't seen a concrete argument why XORing in additional sources (if weak or even completely manipulated) would weaken the original source from crypto/rand - would be interesting to know of there exists specific attack vectors in that scenario.

```
_, err = app.client.Call(""broadcast_tx_sync"", params, &result)

One that we no longer support. We could implement it, or we could port it to call our RPC, but then this would still be one RPC making another HTTP request to talk to another RPC in the same process, which makes little sense. It ended up this way as we adopted a cautious approach in the refactor.

I have elected to instead delegate to our existing tested BroadcastTx implementation.

...

This also lead me to look at the history of the 'tendermint' endpoint (running on 46657 by default). This RPC was split into our 'rpc/tendermint' and Tendermint's own native RPC. Since we are running in-process we have no real need to run Tendermint's RPC (and it seems to me less can go wrong if we don't), but transactor was still expecting a Tendermint endpoint (though it looked similar to ours).

I then noticed that we are actually trying to run both our rpc/tendermint and Tendermint's native RPC on the same address and port (46657 by default). This obviously will not work. I think the best thing is to not run the Tendermint native one at all for now.

I have tried to take an approach that either simplifies or leaves things alone. I was tempted to rename/rearrange some config, but the fix works without that so I have avoided it.

fixes https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-pm/issues/212

I had some trouble convincing myself this could really be a bug, because as far as I can see it will have been a bug pretty much forever, and it's kind of fundamental. I think the reason it was not spotted is because we generally make very generous gas allowances, and for reasons I don't understand when EVM `CALL`ing (and friends) the gas allowance for those calls (allowed to the callee) must have been small to that available for the caller.

Explanation:
At the beginning of executing `CALL` and friends (`CALLCODE`, `DELEGATECALL`) we pop off a gasLimit value that the callee should be allotted for its execution:

``` go
gasLimit := stack.Pop64()
```

We make sure the callee is not asking for more gas than the caller, and provided it's not, we pre-emptively remove the full allowance before any computation has occurred (don't worry we'll pay it back later).

``` go
            // Ensure that gasLimit is reasonable
            if *gas < gasLimit {
                return nil, firstErr(err, ErrInsufficientGas)
            } else {
                *gas -= gasLimit
                // NOTE: we will return any used gas later.
            }
```

But then when we make the actual child call we use `gas`, which is now the _difference_ between what caller has allotted and what the callee should be allowed:

``` go
ret, err = vm.Call(callee, acc, acc.Code, args, value, gas)
```

Suppose the caller has 10000 gas, and the caller is allotted (a `gasLimit` of) 9999, then rather than calling with 9999 gas, we are calling with just 1!

For our native contracts we pass a pointer to `gasLimit` (as we should do):

``` go
ret, err = nativeContract(vm.appState, callee, args, &gasLimit)
```

And later we add on the remainder (that wasn't used by the callee):

``` go
            // Handle remaining gas.
            *gas += gasLimit
```

Which seems suggestive enough that this has indeed always been wrong. Unless I'm missing something, which I might be. But I think we should be passing the `gasLimit` we popped off the stack.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/291,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/291,[Architecture] Bring Manager to the foreground in design,"Looking at the current architecture, it seems that the 'manager' concept is not as developed as it might be. By this I mean that within the erismint manager, there is really only a tendermint application (eris-mint.go) and no overarching manager.

I think there would be an advantage in re-jigging things a bit to make the manager a stronger concept. Here is my initial proposal:
### Create a manager interface and a managers registry

I would propose a `Manager` interface like:

``` go
type Manager interface {
    NewManagerPipe(managerConfig, consensusConfig *config.ModuleConfig,
        eventSwitch *events.EventSwitch)
}
```

And also a registry of supported managers, currently it would just be 'erismint'. I think we should look to some simple form of dependency injection for inspiration on how to implement this. It seems ideal for the kind of code we have that 'reconfigures' itself depending on config.

`NewCore` would make a single call to `NewManagerPipe` dispatching off the manager config value and setting up an instance of the erismint `manager`. I would propose:

```
rename:    manager/erismint/erismint.go -> manager/erismint/application.go
create:      manager/erismint/manager.go
```

The manager would be passed consensus and manager config and would be responsible for ensuring compatibility and creating a pipe containing ConsensusEngine, Blockchain, and Application, before returning to `NewCore`.

A specific `Manager` will know about the types of application engine and consensus engine it supports, so this is where we would aim to centralise the mixing of concerns in this regard. Erismint `Genesis` is one object subject to such a mixing, so this could be defined and initialised at this level, as could the associated `ChainId`. Another possibility is logic for bonding/unbonding, where Erismint Application might want to ""run stuff up the chain"" to manager to issue commands to consensus (I'm not sure this is something we want or not). It would also serve as a place to hook in things like replicating to a queryable SQL store, where we are interested in application state and consensus events (just the place to hook - the actual logic would be its own module).
### The relation between Pipe and Manager?

There are some similarities between the current erismint/pipe.go and and the erismint/manager.go I am proposing in terms of what they internally have access to. It might be possible to collapse the implementation of erismint Pipe and erismint Manager to a single concrete type, but I am not sure if this is desirable. In any case I think the interfaces would still make sense as separate entities: Pipe is how the components of a Manager talk to the outside world (via RPC etc), Manager is how the components are assembled and talk to each other (instigated by Manager).
### Arguments for doing this
- It closely resembles what we originally spoke about when outlining the concept of Manager, and it is a natural extension/reorganisation of what we already have.
- It gives a clearer logical branching at startup:

```
Core --> Bootstrap Manager --> Manager checks compatibility --> Manager creates specific ConsensusEngine, Application, and Blockchain that are interdependent
```

rather than the isolation at initialisation of erismint application and tendermint consensus even though they are dependent on each other (we do two string switches, but they still can't share initialisation values).
- It creates a space to handle 'platform-wide' considerations, that is not generic (like `Core` or `Pipe`), but involves a specific combination of our components . Things like Genesis, Validators, Governance.
- If the matrix of 'supported configurations' over consensus engines, databases, execution engines, etc is sparse and the special treatment needed for particular 'supported' cells in that matrix is somewhat significant then it makes sense for us to thing of a single entry point to a particular configuration rather than to treat our system as some massive cartesian product of components.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/277,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/277,[Architecture] Improve synchronisation between application-level and blockchain-level genesis hashes,"Both Tendermint and erisdb have a GenesisDoc. We have a ChainId that we want to evolve into 'ChainHash', and to introduce a human-readable ChainName that is not baked into the genesis doc.

When instantiated a chain we probably want to make sure the application-level genesis doc (and chiefly its hash) is bound to/synchronised with/composed of both our genesis.json one and the Tendermint network's one. We are currently asserting that our ChainId and Tendermint's match. This might be enough, but maybe we should use `Tendermint's AppHash []byte` to bind them more tightly, or maybe we should include Tendermint's genesis (or in general ConsensusEngine's GenesisHash) into the erisdb genesis.

The reason for this is we probably want to know if we are are trying to connect to a different consensus network (i.e. if some p2p settings were changed, but genesis.json was kept the same).

While I'm waffling... we should also check that Tendermint will not read from the filesystem to form its genesis doc when erisdb uses an in-memory version, thus allowing desynchronisation:

eris-db genesis hash = blockchain genesis hash + consensus network genesis hash (?) + eris' genesis.json hash

This refactor clears the way to implement the remaining unimplemented RPC methods. It consolidates disparate and confusing `Consensus` interfaces into a single interface and allows the `Blockchain` to initialised at the level of `Pipe` initialisation in `NewCore`.

It absorbs the previous eris-mint/blockchain struct into a simpler top level interface (a `BlockStore` with a `ChainId`) and has `Tendermint`(I dropped the 'Node') implement both `Consensus` (I dropped the 'Engine') and `Blockchain`.

As Ben originally suggested the blockchain package because a supporting actor to the consensus and manager packages, much like the account and permission packages.

Implementing the remaining RPC methods will be a matter of adding some methods to the Consensus and Blockchain interfaces and implementing them in Tendermint.

burrow,somak12,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/258,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/258,Unable to return array from contract,"Hi,
I have a simple contract which returns few arrays. Works fine in the online solidity compiler. But after deploying it to the chain and invoking it from the app.js its giving the following error. 

Have found a bug related to this https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db.js/issues/27

Any particular reason why this error is occurring?  

My contract is like: 
```javascript
function getMarket() constant returns(uint[], uint[], uint[], uint[]) {
    uint[] memory optionIDs = new uint[](20);
    uint[] memory strikes_ = new uint[](20);
    uint[] memory positions_ = new uint[](20);
    uint[] memory cashes = new uint[](20);
    uint z = 0;
      for (uint i=0; i<10; i++) {
        optionIDs[i] = i;
        strikes_[i] = i+10;
        positions_[i] = i+100;
        cashes[i] = i+50;
        z++;
      }
    return (optionIDs, strikes_, positions_, cashes);
  }
```

Error is:
```

burrow,jasonklein,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/254,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/254,Int values not consistent between contracts or accurately represented in a contract,"Setup:

```
Eris CLI version: 0.12.0-rc2
Go version: go1.6 darwin/amd64
Docker version: 1.12.0, build 8eab29e
```

When comparing `int` types returned from `ForeignContract` to `int` types in `CurrentContract`, data that should be equal are not equal (e.g., `int8(x)` from one does not equal `int8(x)` from the other) and are also not as expected (e.g., `int8(0)` from `CurrentContract` prints out as `127`, from `ForeignContract` as `254` (double 127), neither as `0`. This behavior does not present itself for `int` or for `uint` types.

The attached contracts and EPM script ([intTypesTest.zip](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/files/449641/intTypesTest.zip) - also reproduced below) can be used to reproduce the behavior, by simply running the epm script:

```

Below is the output from running the epm script. N.B.: no `assert` jobs are employed; and `int8(0)` is compared to `int(0)` because that was the original comparison that led to realizing the issue.

I'm not certain of the solution at this point and time. I will leave that for the E-DB team to figure out. Essentially the way the EVM does events is by registering a call and logging whatever information via a Keccak hash of up to 4 indexed parameters (Log1, 2, 3, 4) into the current block of the chain. Everything else is logged as the byte string. This enables one to sync through the entire history of the chain and gather cumulative logs, or watch the chain and await for a log to fire off and respond accordingly...in addition, this they are near free in the Ethereum world so they are heavily used there.

To run integration tests use:

~~So for the time being, these won't be run on Circle. In due course we will run them on Jenkins.~~

I have enabled the tests on circle after talking with Ben, but they are run with separately using the build tag.

I have also fixed the remaining tests that were consistently failing. I've made a couple of changes aiming to improve test stability, but we may still see some flakes, in which case I will try to fix or failing that separate persistently failing tests with further.

Only refreshing the checkCache on non-empty blocks can be seen as an optimisation that it turns out is on shaking grounds: namely assuming that the committing of an empty block implies that the checkCache is clean. This may have been true at one point, but no longer is in general.

This change also fixes an actual real life bug in the reprocessing of an identical transaction in the mempool that is encountered in integration tests.

A tension remains: on a new block, the application would want to reset caches as the block tick is the only reference point; on the other hand, one can argue that the mempool already improves statistically the odds of producing a synchronized sequence of transactions, if indeed the checkCache is preserved (allowing sequentially dependent transactions to potentially be included in the same block*); It has to be added though that if no transactions are committed in the block, then it is likely to assume there are close to no transactions lingering in the mempool.  This provides the strongest argument to stay close to the logic of preserving the block tick for resetting caches.  -> This resolves the tension lined out in point 2., but builds a tension with point 1.

*This can be understood by considering that if CheckTx would work off off the last committed state for every checked transaction, the sequence numbers of sequential transactions in the same block would cause a dependent transaction to be rejected from the mempool.

Hi,
I have 3 validator node running, and one root node on this instance:
When I run genPrivAccount() from eris-db.js I have a good return value of the new generated account, but when i look on the accounts on my blockchain this new account never appear.

Here's my script and the result:

```
var edbFactory = require('eris-db');
chainUrl = 'http://0.0.0.0:1337/rpc';
var accounts = require('./accounts.json');
var edb = edbFactory.createInstance(chainUrl);
edb.start(function(result, error) {
          if (!error){
              console.log(""eris-db success -> "", result);
          } else
              console.log(error);
})

var myAccount = edb.accounts();
myAccount.genPrivAccount(accounts.devchain_root_000, function(error, result){
       if (!error){
               console.log('result = ', result);
//                res.json({ message: 'Account created!', privKey: '', pubKey: '', address: '' })    ;
       }
})
```

```

In the present iteration we run new tendermint as an in-process node which maintains its own EventSwitch. This separation makes some sense, but the RPC which we are not changing yet expects to be able to subscribe to tendermint and eris-mint events without specifying which channel it is interested in.

The simplest solution is to subscribe to both eris-mint's and tendermint's EventSwitch when the RPC Subscribe method is called.

In order to do this we will need to add the tendermint event switch to ErisMintPipe and set it here: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/develop/consensus/consensus.go#L27 which will require exposing it from TendermintNode.

Currently they are mixed together:

This would allow us to compare transactions for structural identity as distinct from byte-wise identity. Although we probably need both given how we update our AppHash and how block hashes are generated.

We would like to use a serialisation standard more portable/widely supported than go-wire.

I would like to consider using something like Avro both to define cross-language transaction types and to produce signable bytes: https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/. We will have to consider the impact of non-determinism in the serialisation, or different byte-wise serialisations of the same data in different implementations.

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/166,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/166,Make transaction signing error-free,"Currently we have two identical interfaces for writing 'sign bytes':

https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/4b5f3cbcc23e6296793ac82bdf29a4f879b9c15f/account/account.go#L37 

``` go
type Signable interface {
    WriteSignBytes(chainID string, w io.Writer, n *int, err *error)
}
```

and:

https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/4b5f3cbcc23e6296793ac82bdf29a4f879b9c15f/txs/tx.go#L66

``` go
type Tx interface {
    WriteSignBytes(chainID string, w io.Writer, n *int, err *error)
}
```

In practice the Signable interface is only used for transactions so provided that is the case I think we should drop it. The interfaces seem to be inherited from go-wire that uses io.Writer and so the possibility of an error infects all callers. In practice we are signing in-memory objects where it should be possible to do so without error. To avoid errors transmitting currently we just panic:

https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/4b5f3cbcc23e6296793ac82bdf29a4f879b9c15f/account/account.go#L46

Not very nice precious.

Instead I propose the interface:

``` go
type Tx interface {
    CanonicalBytes(chainID string) []byte
}
```

This will require checking and removing all `WriteSignBytes` and `Signable` usages

burrow,silasdavis,https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/165,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/burrow/issues/165,Don't use go-wire to hash sign bytes,"txs has a function `TxID`: https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/blob/4b5f3cbcc23e6296793ac82bdf29a4f879b9c15f/txs/tx.go#L367 (to be renamed TxHash)

Currently it uses go-wire.BinaryRipemd160 to generate a ripemd160 hash of the bytes. Since the sign bytes are just a byte slice go-wire adds no value. It invokes some unnecessary reflection, adds a 2 byte prefix, and makes knowledge of go-wire a prerequisite of signing a transaction using vanilla tooling elsewhere.

Instead let's implement it as:

``` go
func TxHash(chainID string, tx Tx) []byte {
    signBytes := acm.SignBytes(chainID, tx)
    hasher := ripemd160.New()
    hasher.Write(signBytes)
    // Calling Sum(nil) just gives us the digest with nothing prefixed
    return hasher.Sum(nil)
}

The following problematic behavior has been observed when creating new contract instances from within other contracts in Solidity:
1. Calling the `new` constructor of another contract from a _top-level_ contract account, i.e. the contract that is invoked by an external call from EPM or JS, always creates a new address as expected.
2. Delegating from the _top-level_ contract to another contract (or further down) to call the `new` constructor creates a new address only upon first invocation. Any subsequent invocation results in creating the same address and as a result the storage that existed at the address is overwritten!

The attached contracts and EPM scripts ([factory-test.zip](https://github.com/eris-ltd/eris-db/files/364748/factory-test.zip)) can be used to reproduce the behavior in the following sequence:
1. Create a new chain
2. `cp epm.yaml.1 epm.yaml` and run it **once** to deploy the contracts
3. Copy the address of the deployed `InstructionManager` contract (which acts as the mentioned _top-level contract_) from the console output and paste it in the first job in the `epm.yaml.2` file
4. `cp epm.yaml.2 epm.yaml` and run it **once**.
5. Take note of the new Instruction contract addresses created by the _level 1 & 2_ factory contracts. Use these addresses to make a copy of their storage, e.g.: `http://192.168.99.100:46657/dump_storage?address=""799DF4C5232A8CB99F8A5237B999B8C84DBF7746""`
6. Run the epm.yaml **again**. This time around it will provoke the creation of already existing addresses by the _level 1 & 2_ factories and the storage at these addresses will be overwritten.

The following is the console output from the above sequence:

```
$ cp epm.yaml.1 epm.yaml

When we pass a bytes32 structure (which is less than 32 bytes) from an epm to a solidity contract function, it works. However, when we pass a bytes32 from javascript to solidity, the contract is unable to hold it. We determined this by passing a bytes32 structure from eris-contracts to a contract which returns the bytes32 structure it received. Rather than returning our bytes32 input, it returns 000000000...

this should have been addressed in #118 

I am also aware of @ebuchman suggestion in #118; but this is not the direction to take as the unified config file does not work:
1. tendermint is configureable through a configuration file (not per se through an exposed api), and writes to this config file (eg `tendermint init`); this is the first reason to separate the config files
2. edb should be able to treat the modules (eg tendermint as consensus) as functional black boxes, and should not have to update it's config file to cater internal changes of modules and their config files;

edb will have its config file and this config will specify the modules their versions and where their separate working directories and config files are.  A combined config file format is unversionable/unmanageable

Going forward with the modularisation the application manager will require configuration options.

github.com/eris-ltd/eris-cm has the responsibility of providing the correct configuration files to containers.  E-DB should not write default configuration files if missing, instead error.

It is proposed there should be a single config file for a single process/chain/container; this implies that in-process tendermint (or later geth vm) needs to be fully configured through eris-db config.  This complicates tendermints and eris-db config handling as there is a dual approach.

The boot process should respect a variety of env vars currently encapsulated in the ecm scripts in this repository. The docker images should be refactored to remove those bash scripts and just boot the edb binary.

Two env vars we will use frequently but that I do not think are currently respected:

`ERISDB_FAST_SYNC` which should be an easy way for us to turn fast_sync to try via env vars when booting from containers.
`ERISDB_SEEDS` which should be an easy way for us to pass in the IP address of the seed to the binary.

Obviously, all env vars should overwrite anything in a static config file.

a factoryfactory creates a factory which creates a contract that is tested.

this test has some stability which is at the vm level. same contracts, same chain setup, etc. everything else is isolated but with divergent results.

the sometimes failing test is:

```
Executing Job                                 getGSFactoryAddr

Too little data; usually means a bad return from a contract
```

The error message means that eris-pm is expecting a return from the contract but that does not happen.

To recreate:

have eris-cli on develop
pull eris-pm on develop (or mergeCompilers branch if that is not merged)
current eris-db:0.11.3 image

Comment out line 180 in eris-pm/tests/test.sh (so you can examine the chain logs after failure).

run:

`tests/test.sh app17 && tests/test.sh app17 && tests/test.sh app17 && tests/test.sh app17`

or however many times you need to.

It would have methods for transacting, getting a stored value by key, and getting the entire list of stored values (with optional filters).

One problem with this when using local signing. In that case the transaction should be passed like any other, using the `broadcastTx` method. The alternative is to add the nameTransact function to transactions, and keep all transactions in the tx object. It's just temporary anyways, and will at some point be replaced with only local signing.

Another question is what to name it. ""names"" seems a bit ambiguous. It's a regular map as far as I know, which happens to be used for names atm. If `name` should be in it then I personally think that `namereg` (or some variation) would be the best choice. We should also be consistent and refer to it as the Tendermint name registry component everywhere.

- update the docker image to comply with the current eris platform paradigms.
- as discussed on Slack, we want the erisdb:0.10 container to be compiled with the following binaries:
  - tendermint
  - erisdb
  - barak
  - debora
  - erisdbss
- this will make for a heavy image, but as most of the image's ""weight"" is in the OS layer it is really only a difference of about 30MB (in the grand scheme of things that's not a lot). the advantage of compiling all of these binaries is that because all of the data can be mint based we are able to put the image in `cli` mode and turn on its `rpc` via the proper mint binary, or in `server` mode and turn on the `rest|stream` api via erisdb, or in `test` mode and turn on the `erisdbss`. this will make for a powerful and flexible image.
- the last change, which is making the tests fail and so will need some work before merging into develop is an update to mint to the current head of tendermint permissions branch. 
- updates circle to build and push an image when we push to master.

**Note** the start script may need some massaging to make this work seamlessly with the platform.
