This is a read only mirror, however. Please submit your change using gerrit.

you would need to check out the repo here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/fabric-test and make your edits, pushing them to gerrit

here is a walkthrough for zephyrproject which is much the same WRT setting up an LFID, adding ssh keys, etc:
https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/1.1.0/collaboration/code/gerrit_accounts.html

feel free to ask on rocket.chat - https://chat.hyperledger.org/ - discuss in #fabric

one note: when you set up your LFID do not use social logins the first time, create the account and you can add social logins later",2017-10-31 05:08:09,2017-10-31 05:08:09
