I am building a Serverless API (https://github.com/mataide/serverless-hyperledger), but I dont have write permissions on Lambda, so I need to Composer Wallet Filesystem to be readOnly.

## Steps to Reproduce

2. Do a Network Ping

## Existing issues
- [ ] https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/4020

<!-- please include any links to issues here -->

## Design of the fix
This was done due to work in a serverless system, we dont have write access to composer files, it should be read-only.

## Issue/User story
#4245 - Adding to the REST Server the support for the returning and read-only transactions introduced in #4165 .

## Steps to Reproduce
see #4245

## Design of the fix
> loopback-connector-composer
- Extended method `create()` to return values after submitting transactions
- Added `discoverReturningTransactions()` to retrieve the list of all returning transactions in the business network

> composer-rest-server 
- Added `registerReturningTransactionMethods()` - Register the composer methods for returning transactions on the REST API.
- Added `registerReturningTransactionMethod()` - to register each composer named transaction method as a POST method on the REST API.

## Validation of the fix
Currently using the returning transactions via REST Server in a separate project successfully.

## Tests
Tests added in both packages with 100% coverage, covering multiple scenarios depending on decorators `@returns` and `@commit`

## What documentation has been provided for this pull request
Refactored the endpoint description to `Execute returning transaction <transaction-name>`. The `@returns` decorator already provides a self-explanatory description of the response on the REST API.",[],30,2018-07-31 11:26:15,2018-08-01 07:10:08,2018-08-01 09:38:02,True,2018-08-01 07:10:08,sstone1,unknown,,closed

the source connection.json used in the BN cards for this tutorial could be in a different order (eg was 'peer, peer, orderer, ca' now 'orderer, peer, peer, ca' in recent micro releases). This will replace regardless of where in the order the stanza is. Its to allow persistent  REST server container to contact the other dockerized Fabric nodes in the network.

Allow proxy configuration to accept an override for the REST server URL in two environments:

This went in the first drop - a single URL override.

Example:
```
export REST_SERVER_URL=https://dogecorp.com:3000
```

## REST_SERVER_URLS

This is new in this PR - a JSON string containing business network name to URL mappings for multiple business networks - useful for generic deployment scripts. The application knows which business network that it should look for.

Example: 
```
export REST_SERVER_URLS='{
    ""basic-sample-network"": ""https://basic-sample-network.dogecorp.com"",
    ""vehicle-manufacture-network"": ""https://vehicle-manufacture-network.simoncorp.com""

Thus, this won't substitute the actual Authentication process. Rather it can be an optional support for both early-project development and authentication process.

## Issue/User story
[#3763](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/3763) - As a User, having an APIKEY would provide a first level of security while focusing on the development of the business network

Using an APIKEY would help to adopt a easy-to-setup first layer of security to the development of early-stage projects. 
Threads on Rocketchat discussed about passport-local solutions where users are pre-loaded on db to provide a simple security layer over the project. e.g. [Rocketchat Thread](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/composer?msg=MaXLCfWrPXNgZAj7d)

The idea is to provide this APIKEY layer as a option which can be used either:
- In early-stage development of projects which doesn't need a complete Auth process.
- As an extra layer of security to support Auth and TLS security.

## Design of the fix
An APIKEY can be a feature to control the communication between multiple APIs in the same network. 
To enable an APIKEY on the Composer Rest API we can either:
- Setup an environmental variable `COMPOSER_APIKEY` 
- Add a param `-y APIKEY` via the command line when starting the composer-rest-server.

If APIKEY is enabled, for each call to the REST API Composer will check if the correct APIKEY is passed as `x-api-key` header of the request.

## Validation of the fix
Unit tests have been deployed and run to test all cases related to API-key. 100% coverage threshold has been reached. 

## What documentation has been provided for this pull request

Had @rthatcher , Nikola and @lesleyannjordan test this version !

FYI
In Step 17 - the final paragraph

From L-A: ""I think needs reworded. As it implies once the above commands completes both Alice and Bob will have access the business network, then later on it says they need to create new business cards to access the business network"".

I suspect it should be more along the lines:

_""Once this command completes, the business network will have been started. Both Alice and Bob will have been granted to access the business network to start to set up the business network, and onboard other participants from their respective organizations. However, both Alice and Bob must first create new business network cards with the certificates that they created in the previous steps and import them into the business network before they can access the business network.""_

to become:

_""Once this command completes, the business network will have been started. Both Alice and Bob will have been granted access to the business network and, as administrators, have authority to onboard other participants from their respective organizations. However, both Alice and Bob must first create new business network cards with the certificates (that were created for them in the previous steps) and import the created cards into the card store, before they can access the business network from their respective organisations.""_

Substantial re-work of e2e tests:
 - moving parts broken out into folders to match
 - move to using ts files through all test specs and utilities
 - removal of binary files (now generating bna files in tmp dir from resources)
 - use of constants file to specify constant/global test items in all tests
 - ensuring that if publish fails, the tests (and consequently the build) fails
 - publishing of composer-playground to verdaccio to enable testing with npm playground with fabric
 - use of pm2 to run verdaccio (start/delete)
 - change of verdaccio port to prevent possible clash with other integration tests and increasing max_body_size to enable composer-playground to be published
 - breaking up of script files to make them more maintainable/understandable
 - removal of unused imports in test specs 
 - change of npm composer-playground protractor test port to be different from the local cli.js test

Closes #3437 - unnecessary deserialisation of results from a query.

Design of fix:

Inside `engine.queries` perform a `context.getAclManager().getAclFile()` check prior to looping over all objects. If no ACL file is present, short-cut the check; otherwise, proceed with the promise chain check as before.

New unit test added to ensure that if no ACL file is present then the `accessController.check` is not called and that all resources present are returned.",[],2,2018-03-08 14:59:10,2018-03-09 09:17:32,2018-03-09 10:42:16,True,2018-03-09 09:17:32,nklincoln,unknown,,closed

## Issue/User story
<!--- What issue / user story is this for -->
Business network cards; operationally, what is the process when an identity's certificate expires? #3036

This is an enablement change for #3036.

When using re-enroll in Hyperledger Fabric, the existing public key of the user is sent to the CA and a new certificate is issued. The new certificate does not match the old certificate (due to the new validity period, amongst other things), and so the new certificate no longer matches the identifier of the identity in the identity registry.

This change uses the public key (embedded in the certificate) as the identifier of the identity in the identity registry, which will not change across re-enroll operations, solving the problem above. The new certificate will have the existing private key, which will still match the identifier of the identity in the identity registry.

These changes also introduce common certificate parsing code across all runtimes, and real certificate generation across the embedded and web runtimes (instead of fake certificates being used).

This is a breaking change and will require a version bump to v0.18.0 along with the changes for cloud wallets being delivered by @mbwhite.

It was necessary to change the generator to enable passing of parameters through as command line options ... which itself pulled in a new dependancy

Following this change it was possible to add integration tests to drive the new generator, within which we programatically:
- generate bus net over cli
- install busnet
- run busnet tests
- deploy busnet to Fabric
- create assets in deployed bus net
- run sample transaction to update asset

When this flag is passed the command will return all the card's names, one for each line.

It fixes #3026

Some thoughts:

- When `--quiet` is passed alongside `-n` then quiet is ignored, since the output would be the same as the input `-n`. So, `composer card list -n card@name -q` is the same as  `composer card list -n card@name`. I have not added any information about this since it seems obvious and it would just pollute the help instructions..

There are the builds for the v0.16.x releases - the 'latest', and 'unstable' builds
There are the builds for the v0.17.x releases - the 'next' and 'next-unstable' builds.

'latest' is the most stable, and should be used for most purposes. 'next' is the upcoming release, (currently a v0.17.x).  

'unstable' (technically this could be written as 'latest-unstable')  are 'next-unstable' are candidate builds for that could become the next 'latest' or 'next' respectively.

### Changes
The changes here are no different from the ones in the v0.16.x in functional terms. But what is different here is that the code has been refactored to reduce duplicate code, and reduce the length of special cased code paths. 

There is a standard set of fns, in the `core.sh` file. This is pretty much the single source of processing of the TRAVIS env variables to work out what type of build this is. 

Also it has some helper functions for exiting the build in a controlled manner.

The special case codepaths, especially for the deploy phases was quite long. This left a large chance for errors to creep in, in code that was seldom executed.  This has been reduced the minimum

<!--- Provide a general summary of the pull request in the Title above -->
The explorer hang is caused by the swagger-ui javacript code in the browser setting the response type in the XHR object to only accept 'blob'.  It throws an error if text comes back (as with an error message) which appears on the browser console, and leaves the 'waiting' indicator spinning indefinitely.

The fix is to configure the swagger-ui for this route to accept 'application/json' in the list ahead of 'application/octet-stream'.

Resolves #2647.

There's a significant amount of asynchronous promise based code in the runtime access controller that isn't actually asynchronous; this can be improved by filtering the list of valid ACL rules in a synchronous manner before checking the predicates of those rules.

Log formatting occurs **all** the time, regardless of whether or not logging is enabled. This is quite a problem for the ACL code, which quite rightly logs out a lot of information as it processes ACL rules.

Don't be a fool, check the log level y'all.

Due to the pool of 8 x Duktape JavaScript virtual machines that we run, we need to push the log level into the JavaScript virtual machine on every request. Sad times.

Use fixed `go-duktape` that fixes:

- Duktape memory leak caused by context tracking code in `go-duktape`, that we are exacerbating by regularly binding new Go functions to JavaScript.

Ensure the build uses the right version of `go-duktape` by adding a check for the correct Git submodule remote URL - whenever we change this, it tends to result in people undoing the change due to merge failures.

Enables the user to specify using npm config set the values used for the footer links to docs, github, tutorials and community as well as the google analytics ID to use and registry for the npm sample networks. Changes to configuration take effect once the area configured is rebuild (playground or playground-api)

## Changes made:
### Composer Playground:
- **package.json** - Config section added to specify the default values for the links in the footer. Users can overwrite these by changing the values in package.json or using the npm config set command.
- **config/webpack-common.js** - Updated to include the GAID configuration value in the metadata and write the configuration from package.json and npm config to src/config/config.json for use in angular.
- **src/index.html** - Made google analytics only be added if configuration value set for GAID before build.
- **src/footer** - Links now hide if no value for that link exists in the config settings. Links direct to URLs set in the config. Uses config service to access config file written to by webpack common.

### Composer Playground API
- **package.json** - Config setction added to specify default values for use when getting the sample networks: search-url, search-query used for getting a list of sample networks and metadata-url, metadata-query for use when getting the metadata of a package by name.
- **routes/npm.js** - Updated getSampleNames to use config search url and query, if no values found it uses the default of npm registry with current querying. Updated extractMetaData to use config values and replace $PACKAGE_NAME in the metadata query with the package name being searched for to allow for query formats that differ to the npm registry version. If no config settings are found for the metadata url and query then the defaults of npm registry are used, the same as before.

## Testing
- Tested manually with firefox browser.
- Performed and updated unit tests locally for changes.",['jt-nti'],3,2017-11-15 14:43:37,2017-11-23 18:40:51,2017-12-21 10:37:33,True,2017-11-23 18:40:51,sstone1,unknown,,closed

Cucumber based CLI integration test framework and initial tests for Composer
- Adds a new Travis process
- Inside new process integration tests are run:

  - Stand up local NPM server, and publish required modules for testing to it
  - Globally install modules required for testing from local NPM server
  - Install Fabric (inside docker containers)
  - Run CLI based commands to flex current code in modules working on top of Fabric using cucumber based scenarios to build a multi-org business network, then build and deploy a BNA file

- Base exemplar tests are currently in place, test extensions are required to incorporate all CLI commands

- Incorporates change of systest package name to /composer-tests-functional to represent the test content (changes to travis publish included)

Update the REST server CLI to use business network cards as per the other commands:
`composer-rest-server -c admin@basic-sample-network`

This means the REST server CLI will drop the `-p`, `-n`, `-i`, and `-s` flags.
The `-c certificateFile` flag will change to `-e certificateFile` to avoid a conflict.
Now that the `-p` and `-n` flags are freed up, we can ditch the capital letters used for `-N namespaces` and `-P port`.

The wallet API for multi-user mode is also being converted to use business network cards, and has also been simplified to make it easier to use:
- Multiple wallets per user are gone.
- Need to call `setDefault` is gone - the first business network card added is set as the default.
- Discovery user (specified on CLI) is not stored in the database along with the wallets.

Documentation updates will follow in a subsequent pull request.

The cucumber tests rely on a method called compareResource to ensure that the results from a transaction meets the expected results from the cucumber table.

The output provided by the cucumber tests were confusing because in some cases the actual vs expected parameters had been inverted when calling the compareResource function. While it was the expected results that were not properly being parsed it was giving the impression that the actual results were wrong.

The cucumber tests rely on a method called compareResource to ensure that the results from a transaction meets the expected results from the cucumber table.  

The output provided by the cucumber tests were confusing because in some cases the actual vs expected parameters had been inverted when calling the compareResource function.  While it was the expected results that were not properly being parsed it was giving the impression that the actual results were wrong.

1) javascriptparser.js 
To make this understand the runtime api properly had to do some work to correct how it saw function statements as well as function delcarations. 
This also meant that the `findcomment` logic had to be updated - and this was moved to work on line basis, rather that token position.

1a) As part of this the javascrtip parser had to be updated to understand the difference between @protected and @public. This means that the syntax of the apiref changelog.txt marks protected methods as ~ not +

2) Minor updates to the class template. noteably, that the heading for the methods does not have the parameters. The html id for the headings is autogenerated, and with the full prototype in it, it wasn't possible to correctly link from other parts of the docs. 

3) Linkage from the other parts of the docs works but the link statements need to be of the form {@link module-class[#optionalfn] } For POC have modified some of these. But there are other issues for updating comments and API docs. 

4) Added in a module/class index that lists the modules and short description.

## Issue/User story
A connection profile gets loaded from disk twice in connect call

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. The issue cannot be repeated. From the code review, it was found that the connection profile gets loaded from disk twice in a single connect request. This is bit expensive computationally.

Yeah so ive tried to fix the problems noted in #2321 but tbh ive probably broken some tests. Ive added a couple of new variables which allow for better copy and information hierarchy in the modals.

There is some weird stuff going on with this SVG.  It appears that the weirdness occurs when you start using >1 fill colour in an SVG.  I can't figure out why that would be at the moment, and I can't make the existing image work with just 1 fill colour, so I've created an alternative one.

issue1012
The original issue was that the user couldn't use a regex on an asset/participant identifier because the automatic generation of ids was highly unlikely to pass the regex test (e.g. email address).
This then moved into a discussion about what the behaviour of Playground should be when creating new instances. The design team have observed that in many cases, the users' first action is to change the generated ID to something they'd prefer and so the idea now is that the playground should not generate any sample data (even the ID) when a new instance is being created via the 'Add Asset\Participant' buttons. 
The effect of this is that a skeleton object can always be generated now but the user will have to add a valid ID before it can be committed to the blockchain.  Also, since validation is only disabled for the generation of the resource, a regex can now be used to restrict IDs and other fields as desired.

<!-- please include any links to issues here -->
I've hit another bug while testing this which is that clicking the 'Include optional properties' checkbox after you've populated the instance via the codemirror editor, resets all your current changes (so you'll lose the ID you entered) and I'll raise that as a separate issue after this.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
Added the capability to 'allowEmptyId' field upon creation of an object instance by the factory in the common project. This is so that the Playground UI and other application clients can create new instances which don't have an identifier immediately. 

## Validation of the fix
<!-- Over and above the tests, what has been done to prove this works? -->
Manual checks of the Playground UI 

This should probably be checked by @dselman or @sstone1 since it's a change to a couple of classes in composer-common, and by @caroline-church or @nklincoln from the UI team too.

where rather than allowing an issued identity to be enrolled indefinitely it restricts it to a single enrollment and if you lose the crypto material then you cannot automatically re-enroll the user. Basically it will stop the confusion of identity not being registered when a user someone re-enrolls a user they had already bound to a participant and not understand why it doesn’t work as effectively it is a new certificate (admittedly for the same identity) and it would then output a different error message this time from the CA saying cannot enroll.

## Issue/User story
Error messages don't include information about what was wrong and from where error was for thrown for example, in case of addition of model files, if same file is added twice, the error message is not informative enough.

https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/1968

## Design of the fix
The direct method to read the stack in JS has been deprecated. In order to get the caller filename and line number, the trick is to throw a dummy error, catch the exception, read and parser stack. This solution has been implemented in new file lib/stackcomponents.js

## Validation of the fix
review of the code.

## Automated Tests
1. The testcase has been added to verify the new code in stackcomponents.js
2. The automated tests has been changed to capture new errors thrown from modelmanager.

The fake CA used by the embedded and the web runtime stores all of the identities that are issued. We need to store the issuer flag (along with any other options) so we can simulate the ACL check performed by the Fabric CA during `createIdentity`.

## Design of the fix

Grammar is incorrect and parses the default double value literal into an object that we then call `parseFloat` on - this causes a wild `NaN` to appear. Fix the grammar to parse the default double value literal as a string so we can parse it into the correct type later on.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
Implement log out by actually invalidating the access token. Also delete the cookies that store the access token and user ID so the client is ""cleaned up"". 

The access token field can be made copyable by using `readonly` instead of `disabled`.

Fix for the invisible scrollbar problem we had!

There are now scrollbars for the content in the docs on the right hand side, the left hand navigation does not need them as it scales independently in the javascript (so scrollbars will change dynamically and be a bit odd). 

Firefox will have both scrollbars as you can't override the defaults. Chrome and Safari will have the above behaviour...not sure about Edge.

@mbwhite please dont worry about raising an issue about this - all sorted in here. 

@nklincoln could you take a quick look, shouldnt take more than a couple of mins to check it works 👍

- addresses #1541

## Steps to Reproduce
- to test both cases, simply use the `marbles-network` from the `composer-sample-networks` and adjust the marbles.cto for the asset `Marble`, change the field type of `color` from `MarbleColor` to `MarbleColor[]`
- deploy the network and generate the Angular application (`yo hyperledger-composer`)
- Access frontend: http://localhost:4200 (default) and navigate to the asset `Marble`
- Perform CRUD operations on Marbles - verification:
    - size is displayed as `radio` input, 
    - color as `checkbox`, 
    - edit/update has the correct values preselected, 
    - list shows correct value(s)

## Design of the fix
- First, the index.js needs to add some more field meta data for asset fields using enumerations (or arrays of enumerations).
- Second, the asset template and component file need to render the corresponding elements and react to form changes (selecting a radio button, checking a checkbox).
- Unfortunately I had to break out of the `FormControl` mechanism, because Angular ran into issues with checkboxes (arrays + using the value of the `input type=""checkbox""`). Online search didn't reveal a nice workaround (just some hacks), so I handle array fields populated by enumerations (e.g. `MarbleColor[]`) completely different. Radio inputs seem to work out-of-the-box with the standard `FormControl` behaviour.

## Validation of the fix
Steps to reproduce show the general verification of the correct behaviour.

## Automated Tests
No automated tests. Exiting tests for the generator only verify that certain files are generated, not their functionality.

Fix for issue #1743 - Copy button is overlaying the content of the text field. 

Quick note on this: Due to the lack of spaces throughout the commands we are putting into the code blocks, some break in strange places. This fix sorts all this, but does leave some commands looking pretty visually ""tight"" to the copy button. This can be fixed by bumping up ``padding-right: 50px`` (currently 35px).

## Issue/User story
Error messages don't include information about what was wrong and from where error was for thrown for example, in case of addition of model files, if same file is added twice, the error message is not informative enough.

https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/1968       

## Steps to Reproduce
1. add a model file and then try to add the same file again, the error will be thrown
2. try to delete a non existent model file

<!-- please include any links to issues here -->

## Design of the fix
All the error message will be now preceded by file name and function name (the line numbers are thrown in js errors itself). The text has also been changed at few places to make it more informative.

## Validation of the fix
<!-- Over and above the tests, what has been done to prove this works? -->

## Automated Tests
The automated tests has been changes to match the modified error strings e.g. in addModelFiles testcases.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
The final part of epic #142! This pull request adds the access token into the REST explorer for authenticated users. This means that a user can:

1. Authenticate to the REST server in a web browser
2. Use the REST explorer to determine their access token
3. Use their access token with any standard HTTP or REST client

The most important part about 3) is that it allows any program to make authenticated calls to the REST API, which was previously only possible by manually extracting the access token from a cookie in the browser.

and end up with an empty wallet on the login screen. While refreshing
the screen does recreate the initial identity cards created by the
playground automatically, it is a confusing state to get into. This
fix prevents any of the initial identity cards being deleted. It
might be that we want to allow, or even encourage, people to delete
some of those admin cards in the future, however that would currently
leave no way to get them back if required and this seems like a
reasonable way to address the problem for now.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
Web connection profiles contain a `networks` object that stores a mapping of business network names to UUIDs. Those UUIDs are the names of PouchDB databases that live in the web browser and store the actual business network data (the world state) for that business network.

Because the web connection profiles contain browser specific data, they are not suitable for sharing across different browsers or even different machines - so we really shouldn't be writing them to the disk via the connector server!

This fix stops the proxy connection profile store from being used at all in the cloud hosted Playground. We don't know why, but socket.io does not work at all when being served from the cloud hosted Playground on Bluemix - might be socket.io, might be something we're doing, might be Bluemix.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
This is a fix I've been meaning to get in a for a while. Essentially, whilst we currently proxy the connector API over the connector server, we do not proxy the connection profile store API over the connector server. This means that the playground stores connection profiles in BrowserFS, and only creates them on disk when the playground attempts to connect using a connection profile.

This fix introduces a proxy connection profile store which interacts with a real, file system based connection profile store. The playground can use the proxy connection profile store as if it was a normal connection profile store, and the proxy will take care of routing the calls to the real connection profile store running on the connector server.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
We have a major version bump coming this week to introduce identity cards.
This is a good opportunity to clean up some of the debt in the historian (see #55 for details).

- Remove the `Historian` registry type, and make the historian work as per the identity registry. This means that an asset registry named `org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord` will be used. This makes the runtime code simpler and the client code simpler. The registry type and ID are not externals, and are only exposed in the query language - it doesn't matter that they are assets - and this improves historian queries as the FROM clause can be dropped.
- Remove system types SystemRegistry, HistorianRegistry, and ResourceId, neither of which are used anywhere.

This PR fixes the existing protractor tests to:
- Pass through the ID card page and login as Admin
- Clear all local storage on test completion
- Interact with new 'slide-out' for BNA import

## Issue/User story
#1412 

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Try running the existing Protractor suite against the identities branch
2. Observe fail
3. Consider fixing the Protractor tests

## Design of the fix
As per description, mainly:
 - AfterAll edit to clear browser storage
 - Conversion of import.ts to interact with slide-out panel
 - Change of editor-define.spec to use the tile selection options that target npm help sample appliactions

## Validation of the fix

<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
There is a single transaction registry in the runtime at the moment, although this will change in pending work to do under issue #55. This transaction registry has a type of ""Transaction"" and an ID of ""default"". We are currently trying to query transactions using the registry ID that matches the fully qualified class name instead of ""default"" - we need to always use ""default"" when querying transactions, regardless of the type.

<!-- please include any links to issues here -->

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
When REST server security is enabled, the LoopBack connector goes into ""multi-user"" mode. This means that each authenticated user has their own business network connection, that uses their own identities from their wallet. The LoopBack connector maintains a pool of these connections, and expires them after 5 minutes.

The REST server provides a `Wallet` implementation, `LoopBackWallet` that provides a view into the `WalletIdentity` data source. However, most of the methods in `LoopBackWallet` do not use the LoopBack APIs correctly - the where clause is not specified, and they end up selecting the first `WalletIdentity` the data source returns.

When the LoopBack connector expires a connection from the pool, the next request reconnects, which results in a lookup of the wallet to retrieve the identity. The problem above causes it not to find the identity (which is still there and still valid), so the code attempts to re-enroll - if successful - another identity is added into the wallet, but it's likely not to be bound to a participant in the identity registry.

The fix fixes `LoopBackWallet` such that it uses the LoopBack APIs correctly, and also fixes the unit tests to detect and prevent this problem from occurring in the future.

## Issue/User story
See #1756.

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. Create models with references to namespaces in other CTO files.
2. Run `composer generator create`.
3. Inspect/Try to compile the generated TypeScript.

## Existing issues
<!-- Have you searched for any existing issues or are their any similar issues that you've found? -->
<!-- please include any links to issues here -->
When asking about the issue in Rocket Chat it was [recommended to submit a GitHub Issue](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/composer?msg=hyCq33PwyZggsE6Y9).

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
The high level design of the fix is to find all non primitive property types within the class declarations, except enums, within a specific model and index them.  Then the namespace imports for the specific model are also indexed and the types that aren't in the current file are added as TypeScript import statements importing the type from the file it is located in.

## Validation of the fix
<!-- Over and above the tests, what has been done to prove this works? -->
I've included the before and after generated files along with a diff of one of the files generated.

Identity activation operation is non-determinstic and fails when using endorsement policies #1646 

Changes are:
- Fix AdminConnection and BusinessNetworkConnection so they supply a client generated transaction UUID and timestamp. They were blank, which meant that the runtime code generated them, which was different on different peer nodes!
- Whilst investigating this, it turned out event publishing was also non-deterministic as it was generating a timestamp for each event. Have fixed this so that the timestamp from the transaction is used for all events.
- It is not possible to connect to an event hub for a peer owned by one MSP using an identity from another MSP (e.g. Org1 cannot connect to the event hub on a peer owned by Org2). This makes it very difficult to do any kind of multi-organisation stuff so I've changed the connection profile code to accept peers with only requestURLs or only eventURLs - as long as you specify at least one of each.
- Finally, and most importantly, I have reworked the system tests so that they use a multiple organisation Fabric v1.0 deployment with an endorsement policy - which catches both of the errors fixed by this PR - and will stop them occurring in the future.",['sstone1'],4,2017-07-24 06:37:16,2017-07-24 08:21:11,2017-07-24 08:23:06,True,2017-07-24 08:21:11,davidkel,unknown,,closed

## Issue/User story
When a model is created then namespaces are defined by user in model file. There is no check in composer to test duplicate namespaces. Issue #1174 

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1.Create a model file with addition of a namespace twice, run command to create archive. The archive will be created without any error or messages

- [ ] [Rocket Chat history](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/composer)



## Design of the fix
While adding the namespace when model is created, a check has been added whether namespace already exists or not. If exists, an error is thrown otherwise namespace is added. This is a logical point to add this kind of check.

## Validation of the fix
a code review has been done

## Automated Tests
The four tests has been added to confirm that the fix is working. The change is in two functions. Two testcases for each function has been added.

   1. add a namespace for string, then again try to add second one with same namespace. Composer will throw an error ""namespace already exists""
   2. add a list of namespaces (with some namespace repeated) for a string, the composer will automatically check for duplicate namespace and throw an error ""namespace already exists""

composer,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/composer/pulls/1579,https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/pull/1579,sstone1,Improve build performance,"- Remove install of Docker and Docker Compose which takes AGES and they are already at the latest levels, possibly a result of recent upgrades to the Trusty build environment.
- Remove sudo for pip which spews warnings, and combine into a single pip command.
- Add lerna to npm install, and combine into a single npm command.
- Use lerna bootstrap instead of npm install which massively reduces install time.

It seems that npm install spends a long time doing something, where lerna bootstrap does not. It might be that npm is struggling to deal with the huge number of dependencies that lerna dumps into node_modules? 

I'm in favour of keeping npm install as is (automatically runs lerna bootstrap) as its easier for first time contributors to use, but we don't have to use it in the builds.",['sstone1'],4,2017-07-17 08:16:50,2017-07-17 09:17:19,2017-07-17 09:17:21,True,2017-07-17 09:17:19,sstone1,unknown,,closed

## Issue/User story

When a model is created then namespaces are defined by user in model file. There is no check in composer to test duplicate namespace. Issue #1174 

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->
<!--- reproduce this bug include code to reproduce, if relevant -->
1. Create a model file with addition of a namespace twice, run command to create archive. The archive will be created without any error or messages.
2.

https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/1189

## Design of the fix
While adding the namespace when model is created, a check has been added whether namespace already exists or not. If exists, an error is thrown otherwise namespace is added. This is a logical point to add this kind of check.

## Validation of the fix
a code review has been done

## Automated Tests
The four tests has been added to confirm that the fix is working. The change is in two functions. Two testcases for each function has been added. 
1. add a namespace for string, then again try to add second one with same namespace. Composer will throw an error ""namespace already exists""
2.add a list of namespaces (with some namespace repeated) for a string, the composer will automatically check for duplicate namespace and throw an error ""namespace already exists""

repeat above two cases when namespace is specified as object

## Design of the fix
The model manager is responsible for validating, adding the model and later on updating it. Hence, the check for the presence of duplicate namespaces has been added in model manager.

## Validation of the fix
A manual code walk through has been done to ensure the fix to work.

## Automated Tests
Four new automated tests has been created and added. The testcases try to add the duplicate namespaces in various scenarios and the model manager throws error in all these cases.

composer,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/composer/pulls/1468,https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/pull/1468,sstone1,Allow ACL rules to resolve and navigate relationships,"Rework the runtime access controller to permit ACL rules that resolve and navigate relationships.
For example, when writing an ACL rule for an asset, you often want to look at the owner of the asset and make the decision based on some property of the owner.

Here is a daft example:

```
rule R7 {
    description: ""The owner of a vehicle can update the vehicle""
    participant(p1): ""systest.accesscontrols.SampleParticipant""
    operation: UPDATE
    resource(p2): ""systest.accesscontrols.SampleParticipant""
    condition: (p1.asset.owner.firstName === p2.asset.owner.firstName && p1.asset.owner.asset.owner.lastName === p2.asset.owner.asset.owner.lastName)
    action: ALLOW
}
```

The changes require quite a bit of work:

- Repurposing a lot of code from `QueryExecutor` into `Resolver` so that resources can be prepared for lazy resolution.
  - Lazy resolution uses `CallbackRelationship` to callback into the resolver on property access and trigger resolution.
- Updating `Resolver` to create `InvalidRelationship` objects for invalid or missing relationship targets. These do not throw until you try and access a property in the resolved item.
- Rewriting `AccessController` to be asynchronous and use promises, because now resolution may occur in the middle of an ACL check.
- Updating `AccessController` to use the lazy resolution feature of the resolver and re-run the ACL checks until no more resolution is required.",['sstone1'],3,2017-07-04 21:21:55,2017-07-05 10:42:36,2017-07-06 22:36:23,True,2017-07-05 10:42:36,sstone1,unknown,,closed

This fixes #1392 by stopping the use of `thing.constructor.name` which when webpacked in production mode will not work because webpack/uglify changes the name of the classes. It's an evil way to check the type anyway, so just use `instanceof` instead.

- Add the `assert` library into global scope for transaction processor functions - it makes writing transaction processor side tests a lot easier!
- Add new system tests around query files and the new `buildQuery` and `query` runtime APIs.

We can perform this activity when listing all of the assets in an asset registry with the GetStateByRange function in the Fabric chaincode as it uses the `startkey` and `endkey` parameters which are specific to views, however this does not seem to be available in Mango queries.

The easiest way to do this is to add new `$registryType` and `$registryID` properties to all persisted resources that can be indexed and easily added to a Mango query to restrict the queries to a specific registry.

1. Run `composer-rest-server` with `-P` flag for the port
2. Below screen shot shows an example response with `-P 3005` . Log shows `Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3005` as specified.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->

Fixed it because when someone gets a wrong log, they may be prompted to visit the url in the logs, instead of what they passed in as a parameter value.

## Validation of the fix
<!-- Over and above the tests, what has been done to prove this works? -->
It's relevant to where we check if the Port was provided as one of the CLI arguments. I've reset loopback/express' `app.get('url')`, since loopback uses the provided `config.json` by default to set this global `url` property.

This is part of #863, though only acts to lay the foundations from which to build and extend Protractor tests (suites).

Once a suitable base set of tests are completed, the test run should be integrated into the build process.

The tests are run via the composer-playground package file via:
 - npm run e2e:main (builds distribution before standing it up on a server as a target for Protractor)
 - npm run e2e:nobuild (does not perform build stage above)

All tests live in composer-playground/e2e/tests

#1092 

## Steps to Reproduce
Import BNA, read the import list of files (look at models coming in ... )

## Design of the fix
Edit html to pre-pend with ""models/"" Note that this will change with changes inbound relating to file name changing in composer, but at the moment we are being consistent with the way we deal with model files via namespace.

## Validation of the fix
Visual check on multiple browsers

## Automated Tests
To be part of Protractor tests

Previous behaviour was to create a new subscription to the same event upon return to page - this was resulting in actioning all subscriber callbacks when an event was emitted. This was resulting in both a memory leak, and the code being executed on out of date information.

## Steps to Reproduce
Detailed within #1091 

## Design of the fix
Cleanup within an ngOnDestroy, that switches a flag used by a ""takeWhile"" applied to the subscription

## Validation of the fix
Application of best practise clean-up for angular subscribers. Manual testing completed against original scenario, in addition to exploratory testing.

## Automated Tests
Updated existing unit tests.

composer,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/composer/pulls/1095,https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/pull/1095,nklincoln,Condition editor define for page re-visit,"Within #1091 a page revisit to the Define section was not initialising correctly, this pull request fixes that by:
- calling set page if editor service returns a set file
- ensuring the business network changed callback always works from an updated file list 

## Design of the fix
The page needed to set the current file rather than accept a file retrieved from the editor service, this is because during the file setting, additional flags are applied that indicate if it may be deleted etc.

The business network changed callback needed to ensure that it was running with the most recent file list as it had the potential to use an out of date file list during validation.

## Validation of the fix
Manual test on local build, extension of automated tests to prevent regression.
Pending memory leak tests, and that will be the subject of following PRs

Delivers:
 - new ""delete confirmation"" modal
 - file validation on file selection
 - if file selected that is already in editor, will not reload
 - validation of all files within business network
 - conditioning of ability to deploy business network based on all BN files being valid
 - test addition for new delivered components
 - test extensions for modified components

## Design of the fix
Follows user flow of named user story.
Modal confirmation enables deletion of named file within business network.
Validation of all business network files enabled and now all files must validate before enabling deploy

## Validation of the fix

## Issue/User story

This fixes issue #255 and #804.

## Design of the fix

In order to make code blocks work within ordered lists in markdown, you need to add a blank leading line, then indent the _entire_ codeblock by 8 spaces. The glossary fix has added a whole bunch of terms and explained the existing terms more concisely.

## Validation of the fix

Looks good on my local build.

<!-- please include any links to issues here -->

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
The HLFv1 connector has an abstract list() method which means we cannot determine which business networks have been deployed to the specified Hyperledger Fabric instance. I have implemented it to use the queryInstantiatedChaincodes() function from `fabric-client`.  Handily we can use the `path` property for each instantiated chaincode to test for Composer business networks.

The admin connection code has been extended to ping() the business network on connection, if a business network was specified. Before, for HLFv0.6, we tested the presence of the business network in the connection profile, but since we aren't recording the business network -> chaincode ID mapping anymore this check was not run for HLFv1.0. By using ping(), we can validate that the business network is deployed and running.

## Validation of the fix
<!-- Over and above the tests, what has been done to prove this works? -->
Tested locally against both HLFv0.6 and HLFv1.0.

## Automated Tests
<!-- Please describe the automated tests that are put in place to stop this recurring -->
Unit tests added to cover code changes.

## Design of the fix
Relationships are now serialized as URI using the form:
```resource:<namespace>.<type>#<id>```

## Validation of the fix
- Refactored existing tests
- Added new tests to ensure URIs are handled correctly, including when the identifier contains unicode.
- Added a test that creates a Vehicle from the DVLA network and roundtrips it to JSON

## Automated Tests
All tests are automated

- A lot faster than Otto (native TypedArray/Buffer support _really_ helps)
- Seems to have lower memory requirements than Otto
- Has CommonJS module loading support, which Otto does not have
- Is written in C and so is a lot more portable to other environments than Otto
- Looks like it is a lot more actively maintained than Otto
- Supports JavaScript regexes, not Golang regexes

go-duktape (https://github.com/olebedev/go-duktape) provides Go bindings to duktape.

In no way is this an alternative to adding native Node.js chaincode support to Hyperledger Fabric and switching to that, however this resolves a lot of performance related problems with using Otto with relatively little fuss.

composer,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/composer/pulls/682,https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/pull/682,nklincoln,Enable BNA export test,"As part of #658 and following an undetected code breakage in the export component, a solution to the enabling of the tests for this component has been provided.

Also changed name of method from ""openExportModal"" to ""exportBNA"" since the method doesn't open a modal for user input.

## Design of the fix
Jasmine seems to have a known bug for running tick() inside fakeAsync when the component itself has multiple promises. This means that calling tick() doesn't actually work.

Work around for this was to revert to the Jasmine done() option, and utilise a fixture.whenStable().then( ... ) to check that the required path was traversed. Any failings of the internals of the file creation/save will result in a broken promise chain and a timeout error reported by jasmine, but the promise rejection clearly visible in the test logs. 

## Validation of the fix
Coded test, broke code->test failed, fixed code->test passed

The orderer batches up transactions for a set period of time before committing them and sending them to the peers. Only when that happens do the block and transaction events get emitted by the peers back to the clients. Composer needs those events in order to know that a transaction has been committed and it is safe to return control to the caller.

I have changed the batch timeout parameter to 250ms down from 10s.

These changes are encoded into the genesis block, so I had to run the `configtxgen` tool:
`configtxgen -profile TwoOrgs -outputBlock twoorgs.orderer.block`

## Design of the fix
Used a map to hold parameters that are to be hidden from view. Considered pushing/pulling at areas, but decided that holding parameters in a map would be safer and more extensible.

No longer ""stubbing out"" a blank transaction, but using the generate instance method - #409 is editing this function to take additional parameters to generate a meaningful empty declaration. A single parameter change will be required here to enable that change once available.

## Design of the fix
<!-- Focus on why you designed this fix this way, and what was discounted. Do not describe just the code - we can read that! -->
HEAD is broken due to runtime code not returning any value for the runtime call existsResourceInRegistry when the resource does not exist. It works OK if the resource exists or if it cannot be accessed. Fixed it so it always returns a value.
PUT requires that we implement the replaceById operation in the LoopBack connector.

Tested the changes locally.

## Checklist
[ ]  A link to the issue/user story that the pull request relates to
[ ]  Design of the fix


## Issue/User story

Previously, lots of references in both codeblocks/snippets and plaintext to Concerto, have replaced with Composer and verified with Matthew White that the ones in codeblocks can be safely changed. There are still a couple of references to concerto, but they're in links to the GitHub repository storing the syntax highlighter for Atom: https://github.ibm.com/Blockchain-WW-Labs/Concerto-Atom


## Design of the fix

Having only references to Composer makes it lots easier to replace these references with conrefs.

## Validation of the fix

Unvalidated as yet, but am working on getting VirtualBox set up so I can run local builds of the documentation.
