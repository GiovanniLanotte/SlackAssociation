As discussed in the HIPE [0025-indy-docs-framework](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0025-indy-docs-framework/README.md) we would like to have a centralized site for our documentation. The changes I have made are outlined in that HIPE. 

Here, you will see a couple of things: 
- within the `docs/` directory, I've added a `source/` directory for our documentation that should be hosted online, for users and contributors. With this way, the `docs/` directory can also be used for other documents that may not need to be on our user-facing documentation site. Perhaps for more technical docs meant only for maintainers.
- Most of the files changed are just name changes because of the directory rename. 

The significant files added are
- `docs/source/conf.py` - this builds all of the documentation with sphinx
- `docs/README.md` - instructs users on how to build the documentation locally
Thanks for taking the time to review!

What works in this PR:

- [x] Accepting Connection Requests and sending Response
- [x] Proper did, vk, and pairwise creation for the above steps
- [x] Basic web UI

Changes we plan to make that also provide noteworthy information about this PR:
- [ ] Use `nonce`s for request/response and use that as the correlating information to retrieve did and vk to decrypt received messages. Currently, dids are being sent in plain text to provide this correlation.
- [ ] Use one endpoint for all front-end/back-end interaction and use Sovrin messages for communication. (Front end becomes a sort of agent with admin privileges on the main agent.)
- [ ] The web framework we're using is also a point of debate and we are potentially seeking replacements. Large changes may be coming to the front-end.
