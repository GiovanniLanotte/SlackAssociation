It is because of that OS X can not resolve the `$HOSTNAME` by default.
Anyway, This change can fix the problem.

As discussed in the HIPE [0025-indy-docs-framework](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0025-indy-docs-framework/README.md) we would like to have a centralized site for our documentation. The changes I have made are outlined in that HIPE. 

Here, you will see a couple of things: 
- within the `docs/` directory, I've added a `source/` directory for our documentation that should be hosted online, for users and contributors. With this way, the `docs/` directory can also be used for other documents that may not need to be on our user-facing documentation site. Perhaps for more technical docs meant only for maintainers.
- Most of the files changed are just name changes because of the directory rename. 

The significant files added are
- `docs/source/conf.py` - this builds all of the documentation with sphinx
- `docs/README.md` - instructs users on how to build the documentation locally
