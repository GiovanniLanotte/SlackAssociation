Why do you need a way to have the browser use the same network as the agents use to talk to each other ? In my case (Docker under MacOS), there is no choice : I have to open browser tabs with `localhost` and processes have to communicate with internal docker IP addresses (`172.17.0.3` for example). For this reason, I have added this output in each agent console : `Agent Offer Endpoint : ""http://172.17.0.2:8094/offer""`.

Sorry, I don't understand. Which PR are you talking about ? What do you want me to do ? 

> As @dbluhm mentioned regarding the use of a Makefile, it's possible to do what von-network has done, a series of scripts: https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/tree/master/scripts?

In my opinion, using a Makefile is very useful, simple and standard. And it is a (re)emerging standard. For example, https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/manage do the same but without being a standard. If you want to know available commands, you have juste to take a look at the targets in the Makefile. Conversely, with `manage`(above), you have to read many code to extract available commands. And obviously, I have all documented in the README file.

My approach is the following : I list what I'm missing trying to use a lib or trying to run a sample code. For example, following this way, I have contributed with this https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/how-tos/write-did-and-query-verkey/nodejs, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/nodejs/src/anoncredsRevocationScenario.js, ... It is the same here, this repo is a ""reference implementation"", that can be run, and the only/better solution for me (and other future ;-) ) on MacOs, is Docker :-) . As I said, developers are able to understand that this is a reference implementation, with some adjustments for the run.

Message handlers are still registered individually, like this:

`await msg_router.register(CONN.SEND_REQUEST, connection.request_received)`

It would be nice to register a module by message family, and allow each module to route messages to the appropriate handler.
