(original PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1858)

 - Turn easier to implement symmetrical topologies. The Java SDK has classes that can be used to implement clients or a validator without changing anything;

- Using ROUTER <-> ROUTER, the topology completely decouple the messages for any particular worker. I don't know Go, but seeing the code, there is a map to hold references to the worker and a correlation ID being worked on. With the internal fanning proposed in the Java SDK, that isn't necessary at all. That way, long lived actions wouldn't stop a thread, giving the code a real async processing. This [class](https://github.com/CarvalhoLeonardo/sawtooth-sdk-java/blob/aab00d6bf040db695ddd152cc1e6a2ddf66ea380/sdk-transaction-processor/src/main/java/sawtooth/sdk/reactive/tp/messaging/ReceivingHandler.java#L72) holds the interesting bit.

- This approach was taken from [Freelancer](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:10/FLP/) and [Majordomo](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7/MDP/) protocols, that provides full async work, that I think is of interest to the project as a whole.

I traced the problem down to three issues -- two of which this pull request fixes.

One, in _run_docker_test_, the call to _docker inspect_ was not being passed the actual container names created by _docker-compose_. _Docker-compose_ appends a hash value to container names created by the testing scripts (e.g. latest_test-tp-settings_1_47b754af16ac), and these full names were not being passed. The simplest way to get these full container names is to parse stdout from _docker-compose_, so _run_docker_test_ was modified to do that parsing and supply the correct names in calls to _docker inspect_.

Two, the following two docker files had an option passed to _apt-get install_ in the wrong location and that was also causing the _run_tests_ process to fail. These files were edited to have the option in the correct location.
- cli-tests.dockerfile
- python-sdk-tests.dockerfile

Three, the _run_tests_ process intermittently hangs when running the unit-python-sdk tests due to an asyncio error -- sometimes the testing process completes fine, and other times it hangs. Calls to _docker-compose -p latest -f ./sdk/python/tests/unit_python_sdk.yaml up --abort-on-container-exit_ were made manually to elicit a successful and failed test result, and these results are captured in the following file.
 - [unit-python-sdk-test_results.txt](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/files/2729934/unit-python-sdk-test_results.txt)

This change handles the case when an event subscriber connects to the
validator before it has either generated or received the genesis block.
In that instance, chain head is `None`, and an exception is raised, then
the subscriber is left in an invalid state. This fix mitigates that
issue.

when the slice goes out of scope, the memory is not freed. Because Rust is
picky about how you free Strings and Vecs, specifically that the capacity is
accurate, this change keeps Strings and Vecs as they are and passes around
pointers to them, rather than trying to convert them to something else. This
requires holding onto the capacity in addition to the length, but guarantees
that the capacity is correct when the struct is dropped.

This PR removes the `mut` requirement on both the trait and the `ZmqMessageSender` struct, and updates a few function arguments to remove the `mut` requirement as well.

As an example of where this is useful, [Seth's ValidatorClient](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/rpc/src/client.rs#L163) currently requires `&mut self` for nearly all of it's methods simply because it has a `MessageSender` in it. Without this PR, turning those into `&self` references would require wrapping it's `sender` in `Arc<Mutex<...>>` unnecessarily, and with this PR those references can simply be switched to `&self` without any further changes.

This could impact future `MessageSender` implementations, if they required mutability for sending or replying, however that could then be solved by adding `Arc<Mutex<...>>`'s as necessary.

When node is written to the database, if an entry already exists for it, a count is updated in the duplicate log.   When a node is deleted, the count is decremented.  Once there are no duplicates, the count is removed entirely.  Nodes may be fully deleted at this point.\\

This fixes the issue that can occur with state pruning where a fork produces a duplicate hash, whose original value was produced outside of the state pruning window.  Those values would be deleted when the fork was prune, which would cause errors validating transactions that still expected the value to be in state.",['peterschwarz'],3,2018-07-05 22:52:04,2018-07-06 21:57:50,2018-07-06 21:57:58,True,2018-07-06 21:57:50,peterschwarz,unknown,,closed

The extension allows a user to indicate a  regexp during subscription, such that the REST API would return the addresses (in the state-delta changes) that match the regexp. Before this PR it was already possible to indicate a list of prefixes to match the addresses of interest.

The extension proposed is minimal and would be particularly useful for app developers or users with:
- addresses of interest filtered by substring (as opposed to sole prefix)
- do not have direct access to a validator with full-fledged events through ZMQ.

At that time, the amount of time the Chain Controller holds onto blocks should have also been updated, but this was missed. Because of this, it became much easier for the Chain Controller and Completer to get out of sync with respect to the blocks they thought were in the system. With the two out of sync, it was possible for the Completer to send a block to the Chain Controller that was built on a block that the Chain Controller had dropped. This resulted in a forking bug deemed the ""missing predecessor bug"" (STL-901). This commit updates the time that the Chain Controller holds onto blocks. This commit is a temporary bandage to mitigate the out of sync problem.

formatter, `clippy` offers opinions about how code should be written.
Some of these suggestions can be considered ""style improvements"", like
replacing a single-pattern `match` with `if let` and getting rid of
unnecessary `return` statements. 

Other suggestions can actually impact performance, like getting rid of
unnecessary type / ownership converions (`.iter()`, `.clone()`,
`.into()`, etc). One of the more sweeping changes it proposes is to
use pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value where possible. This
supposedly results in fewer allocations (and hence better performance)
and also makes figuring out ownership simpler in some cases.

Overall, `clippy` seems like a very useful tool, and it exposes a lot
of language features that we aren't currently using. Certainly I've
learned a lot about Rust from looking at it.

#### Downsides

1. `clippy` is actually implemented as a set of compiler plugins.
   These plugins rely on non-stable compiler internals, and
   consequently it can only be run on the nightly toolchain. This does
   not mean that we have to switch to nightly; the stable and nightly
   toolchains can be used side by side, and apparently it is not an
   uncommon practice to install nightly for the sole purpose of using
   `clippy`. The drawback here is that sometimes the nightly compiler
   breaks, and so one day our builds could fail without warning. I
   don't know if that's a common occurrence or a rare one.
   
2. Adding `clippy` to the build process seems to add a lot of time
   (look at the build times for this PR). I don't know if there's a
   way to speed it up.

I don't think we have to commit to using it forever. We could try it
for a week or two and then get rid of it if it turns out to be too
much of a hassle.",['nick-drozd'],36,2018-04-12 01:27:21,2018-04-16 20:12:15,2018-04-16 20:12:15,True,2018-04-16 20:12:15,nick-drozd,unknown,,closed

improvements.

The profiling method I'm using here will be a little different from
usual. Rather than running transactions through a network, I'm running
the state verifier over a 300-block blockstore that was taken from an
actual LR network run (many of the functions in the graphs below are
called exactly 300 times). This profiles just the components involved
in transaction execution. Notably, it does not involve the block
publisher or any inter-validator communication, although does include
communcation between the validator and several transaction processors.

Here is a Yappi graph of this setup running master:

![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25748894/37427040-1ea3b2f2-2796-11e8-9077-986a58ad7747.png)

The first commit adds a dedicated single-key `get` method to
`LMDBNoLockDatabase`, where previously `get` was delegated to
`get_multi`. This shaves off almost 2% of CPU time from
`LMDBNoLockDatabase.get`. It also slightly reduces (by ~0.2%) the time
taken by `LMDBNoLockDatabase.update`. I'm not sure why this is; maybe
the database writes don't have to wait as long for the reads?

Here is a Yappi graph after this change:

![db-get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25748894/37427057-2c1ef4be-2796-11e8-8cf1-b20bd1b3eeda.png)

The second commit caches the settings views obtained by the executor.
This seems to be an impactful change. For one thing, database reads
are reduced by about one third. The total CPU time taken by
`TransactionExecutorThread._execute_schedule` goes from ~18% to ~15%.

message deserialization, namely, adding ""preprocessors"" on a

they reach the handlers, deserializing the message content and also
extracting whatever other message information is required by the
handlers. With gossip messages, for instance, there are handlers that
require the message type tag and the message time-to-live in addition
to the batch or block object contained in the message, so those three
things are extracted and stored in a tuple that is passed to the
handlers.

with a higher workload, so I've included a commit to bump the workload
rates. This consistently passes when running locally, but maybe it

- Describe the XO transaction family

- Rewrite ""Game Rules"" and replace TMI with link to Wikipedia

- Convert the two procedures into one: Merged ""how to play"" info
  with the ""play XO with xo client"" procedure to explain what
  the XO TF does in the relevant step

- Add Prerequisites section with:
  - links to the Docker/Ubuntu/AWS dev env procedures
  - new info on opening a Docker client container
  - new prereq on ensuring a connection to the REST API
    (with links where available)

- Move the authentication options to the end, because
  they're not used in this procedure.

Also (second commit): 

- Edit the intro text in ""XO Transaction Family"" spec to match; 
  add links to wikipedia and ""Introduction to the XO Transaction Family"".

And (fixup commit):

- Add more information on what the TP does for each move.

In this implementation, a token pool maintains a set of token bearers, which can acquire and release tokens.  As tokens come in, a token is acquired for that batch.  When the batch is either marked as invalid, or committed, the token is released back into the pool.  The size of the pool is altered at the same time as the pending batch queue.

This includes a number of additional changes:

- Schedulers can return the batch id for a given transaction id
- Containing batch id is included when an invalid transaction notification occurs
- Validator constructor is wrapped in the CLI's try/except (this helps catch syntax errors that can easily occur in that large block of code)

In order to do this, the metrics counter wrapper had to be extended to allow the `dec()` method. This PR also adds the metric to the dashboard.

In order to test this metric, run the `sawtooth-local-poet.yaml` docker-compose file, and set a workload. Since the validators in this compose file use the serial scheduler, we see on the graph that each node has between 0 and 2 transactions in process at a time. Next, edit the validators in `sawtooth-local-poet.yaml` to use the parallel scheduler. We see that many more transactions can be processed in parallel with this scheduler.

It turns out that the function, which is called frequently, was taking a list of transactions and then building out a new list of transaction ids every time just to get the index of one id. Switching from list comprehension / index to an enumeration causes the function to drop off the graph entirely, indicating that it no longer takes a significant amount of time.

![index-after-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25748894/35534434-222f00f0-0506-11e8-9470-3df53ae7e457.png)

The second change has to do with a function called `_txn_is_in_valid_batch`. This function takes around 5% of total CPU time. About 2/5 of that time (2% of total CPU time) is spent in a little function called `_txn_result_is_invalid`, which checks that a signature is in a dictionary called `_txn_results` and, if it is, whether its result is valid. My thought was that this ""look before you leap"" approach in such a tight loop was not efficient, and that it would be faster to construct the set of ids with results beforehand and then check whether they are all valid.

The results in the `yappi` graph are a little strange:

![valid-after-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25748894/35535020-e6040ec0-0507-11e8-901f-1b4fffa19744.png)

If you look where those functions should be (under `next_transaction`), you'll see that they aren't there at all, and that `next_transaction` has gone from 8-9% to less than 4%. Pretty great, right? Well, if you look in the upper left corner, you'll see two new nodes labeled only `<genexpr>`, representing the generators used in the rewritten function. Together they add up to around 4%, which is a savings of 1% of total CPU time.

I don't quite understand why the nodes are floating off in the corner rather than being attached to their calling chain. Is that computation being executed in another thread? If so, is that good?",['nick-drozd'],2,2018-01-29 21:30:58,2018-02-05 14:54:03,2018-03-05 16:41:05,True,2018-02-05 14:54:03,nick-drozd,unknown,,closed

sawtooth-core,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pulls/1364,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1364,peterschwarz,Fix failure to Re-Request,"This fixes an issue where a gap occurs between the 'incomplete_blocks'
cache and the 'requested' cache.  On a long chain, the incomplete_blocks
cache will purge out items that have been received at the beginning,
while the requested cache has a longer lifespan.  When new block appear,
they are touching the entry for predecessors, but only walking back far
enough until they hit an already requested block.

On a chain where we're starting from block N, and need to catch up to M
(where M >> N), block M will be requested first, and be put in the
incomplete_blocks cache.  As we collect it's predecessors, it will
eventually be purged from the cache.  Incomming blocks will proceed to
request their predecessors, until they reach a block that has been
requested (starting with M-1).  Since touching the entry in the cache
resets its cache lifetime, it won't be purged, nor will it purge items,
since that only occurs on a __setitem__ call.  This requested cache entry
is only removed under certain branch conditions, therefore, the gap that
has been created in the incomplete_batches will widen, but never be
refilled.

By removing any block from the requested cache, we can avoid this
situation.

Some of the commits are intended to improve readability.

The functional changes are:
1. A rewrite of the function used to find the common block height between two forks
2. Replacing the result dictionary with a python object to better control the result's fields
3. Promoting the BlockValidator to a long-lived, top-level object.

The last of these functional changes is the most likely to affect performance, as it eliminates the need to instantiate a new block validator object for every block that is validated.

Finally, many BlockValidator methods were modified to be more functional in design, which was needed to support 3 but also improves readability.

These commits are more granular than usual, and I can squash them down if that is preferred. They are granular to reflect the incremental approach I took to make the changes.

1. A Dockerfile that can be used to build an image with all Sawtooth dependencies, and dependencies for debugging using GDB.

2. A docker-compose file that builds the `debug-sawtooth-python` image, runs a script to change the Python interpreter to `python3-dbg` in the validator, rest api, and sawtooth scripts, and creates containers based on `debug-sawtooth-python` based on local files that run a Validator, settings tp, intkey tp, REST API, and a sawtooth shell.

The purpose of this is to allow developers to use GDB to inspect Sawtooth components.

To test:

1. `$ docker-compose -f docker/compose/sawtooth-debug.yaml up`. No building is required prior to running this command as the docker-compose file automatically builds the required image if it does not exist.

2. `$ docker ps` to view running containers.

3. Exec into the desired container. For example: `$ docker exec -it debug-validator bash`.

4. `$ ps aux` to view the running processes once you're in the container, and find the process you want to debug (it should be the validator or the REST API). It will look something like this: 
```
PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
1   ?        Ssl    0:00 python3-dbg /project/sawtooth-core/bin/sawtooth-validator -vv --endpoint tcp://validator:8800 --bind component:tcp://eth0:4004 --bind network:tcp://eth0:8800
```
5. `$ gdb -p _PID_` to attach GDB to the process

You are now attached to the process. You can use use `(gdb) bt` to see the C Python stack trace, or do something like exec into the client shell, send an intkey workload, and step through its execution on the validator.

After you are done debugging, run the following script to reset your python interpreter:

```
#!/bin/bash

This will be an improvement for two main reasons:

1. Most nodes are already likely to have these batches in their pending batch queues from previous gossip messages, so sending these batches is likely to repeat work.
2. This will greatly reduce the message size of broadcasted blocks.

Injected batches will still be broadcasted. At the time of broadcast, only the injecting node will have these batches, and if they were omitted from the block all other nodes would request the batches at the same time.

The reverted change is not backwards compatible with networks running
1.0.0rc5, and thus should be mitigated in another manner. The
incompatibility occurs when running a mixed network of validators
(before and after this change), with the following error occurring:

  Block X rejected: Wait certificate check failed - Local mean does not
  match: A != B

Ideally, all PoET settings should be set in the genesis block (or when
switching to PoET from another consensus algorithm), so that these
settings are always on-chain and the default settings are never used on
new networks.

Currently `sawnet peers list` takes a CSV list of URLs and prints a JSON dict with each URL matched to its peers. The peers are the ones returned by `sawtooth peer list`, ie a list of the network endpoints of the validators. A `--pretty` flag can be passed to pretty-print the JSON. It has been suggested that the default should be to print columns and that a `--json` (or `--yaml` or whatever) flag should be passed if that format is desired.

`sawnet peers graph` takes a CSV list of URLs and writes a Graphviz graph to a file called `peers.dot` (overwriting an existing file if the `--force` flag is passed). If a `--png` flag is passed,  the Graphviz command `dot -Tpng peers.dot -o peers.png` will be executed, converting the graph file to a pretty picture. I assume more file formats can be supported; this particular command was copied from a shell script of @vaporos 's.

The problem with the graph command right now is that there's no general way to correlate a REST API's URL with the network endpoint of its associated validator, so the image produced actually shows two isomorphic but distinct graphs with different names for the nodes. It would be extremely helpful to be able to query for the validator endpoint. There are two options for this:

1) Add a `/status` endpoint that would return the validator's network endpoint, its public key, and maybe other stuff.

2) Change the `/peers` endpoint to include information about the validator being queried.",['nick-drozd'],4,2017-12-22 21:36:18,2018-01-10 18:49:12,2018-01-31 18:38:56,False,,,unknown,,closed

way as to arrive on the EPID revocation list.

Our first default value was to require signups within one block of the
head of the chain. This proves to be far to likely to miss as a validator
may signup as the chain is updating.

In general any congestion on the network decreases the chance of getting the
signup transaction to commit within a block or two.

All we need is to know that the signup was created relatively recently.
Changing to within 10 blocks should stop a lot of spurious errors without
introducing any risk.

The python portion of PoET took this on to verify the NIST 256p ECDSA
signature created in the enclave using the SGX SDK. It used an ECC library
available for python. Sawtooth security reviewers did not have time
to review that library ahead of Sawtooth's planned 1.0 release and it
was not yet listed in available whitelists. It was deemed more secure
in the near term not to use the python ecdsa library until reviewers
can gain more familiarity with it.

As such this commit reverts wait certificate signature verification to
use the SGX SDK's ECC library call.

This commit does not preclude an observer node verifying wait
certificates using its own ECC lib without SGX.

Signing algorithms can be encapsulated with a `Context` and keys with
`PrivateKey` and `PublicKey` objects.

A `Signer` can be used to wrap a private key and a context, which can
then be used repeatedly during operation.  For example, the identity key
for a given validator is loaded at startup time, parsed into a Secp256k1
key, encapsulated in a Signer with the appropriate context, and passed
to all users of the Signer - e.g. the BlockPublisher.

All uses of the old API have been updated to reflect this change.

Introduce indexes and cursors to the Database to improve interaction
with the Database in several ways:  First, indexing is managed by the
database, which is provided a series of index name, index key function
pairs.  Indexes are stored atomically with each update to the database.
The data is segregated using LMDB's child databases.  Currently, indexes
are only sorted by natural key order (this is string-based).

The block store has been updated to support this indexing by adding
indexes for block_num, batch ids, and transaction ids within the block.

Cursors give an efficient way to navigate the underlying database.

**Use iterators, based on the cursors for block list client requests**

Use a block iterator from the block store to list the blocks
efficiently.  The block list has been simplified to only support sorting
based on block number in forward and reverse order. Paging returns just
a `next_id` value.

All tests that no longer fit into this model have been removed.

Additionally,

- Database has been made and Abstract Class
- Database implementations handle serialization/deserialization of the
  primary record
- LMDBNoLockDatabase has been updated to match the new Database
  Interface, but doesn't implement cursor
- DictDatabase has been updated to support indexes and cursors
- chain controller has been modified to check the value of the chain
  head against block store as the source of truth.
- tests have been updated to take indexes into account",['peterschwarz'],9,2017-11-02 21:25:11,2017-11-09 16:37:27,2017-11-09 16:38:05,True,2017-11-09 16:37:27,peterschwarz,unknown,,closed

Summary of changes:
- Reorganize to clarify the procedures (what steps to perform) and reduce confusion. 
- Specify when to open a new terminal window. 
- Docker: List the container names in the container sections. 
- Ubuntu: Rewrite a redundant ""Start the REST API"" step (added ps command to check status) and delete the other redundant step.
- Docker & Ubuntu: Correct the output for ""Viewing the List of Blocks"". 
- Change ""intkey"" and ""IntKey"" to IntegerKey unless referring to the actual intkey command. 
- Make heading titles (aka tasks) clear and consistent between procedures.  
- Fix typos, punctuation, capitalization, fonts, EOL spaces, etc. 

Note that this is a light rewrite - there is more work to do in a later pass (for release 1.0).

Test that it works (it will return no blocks, since it assumes you already know the current block):
```
$  curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""id"": ""curl"", ""method"": ""eth_getFilterChanges"", ""params"": [""0x0""] }' http://localhost:3030

Submit a transaction (any that will produce a new block will do) and then repeat the above call.  You should get a block id in the response:
```
$  curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""id"": ""curl"", ""method"": ""eth_getFilterChanges"", ""params"": [""0x0""] }' http://localhost:3030

Specifications” section:

- Add “Transaction Family” subtitle

- Remove outdated information (per Peter) about providing an “out of
  the box” ledger and being sufficient for building, testing and
  deploying a marketplace for digital assets

- Add missing TFs, with a draft description for each: Settings,
  Identity, Smallbank, Seth, BlockInfo, XO, Supply Chain, Track & Trade

- Change EndPointRegistry to Validator Registry

- Split TFs into three lists:
  + “Core” transaction families (Validator Registry, IntegerKey,
     Settings, Identity)
  + Specialized TFs (Smallbank, Seth, BlockInfo)
  + Example TFs (XO, Supply Chain, Track and Trade)

I hope for review comments to correct this information as necessary - the
descriptions, terminology, organization (do the core/specialized/example 
groupings make sense?), etc.

The Add Fish Form has been updated to take advantage of these services, and now actually adds fish Records to the blockchain.

Adding the `'fish'` is done with a script and a batch that is manually submitted through the REST API, but should later be added to the genesis block when there is an official T&T Docker compose file.

**To Test:**
Follow the setup instructions from [PR-879](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/879).

Additionally, start up a REST API on `http://localhost:8008`.

Then, run the batch creation script:
```
cd families/track_and_trade/server/
npm run make-fish
```

And finally submit the batch to the REST API:
```
curl --request POST \
    --header ""Content-Type: application/octet-stream"" \
    --data-binary @fish.batch \
    ""http://localhost:8008/batches""

## Major Additions

- **API service**: sends HTTP requests to the server API with authorization
- **Payloads service**: encodes Protobuf payloads
- **Transactions service**: 
    - wraps payloads in a signed transaction
    - submits transactions to the API
    - manages encryption and storage of private key
- **Signup form**: 
    - creates a user in the db and a new Agent in the blockchain
    - encrypts a new private key for escrow storage
    - stores the auth token from the API
- **Login form**:  stores the auth token from the API
- **/info endpoint**: returns batcher pubkey and route info

## To Test

- start up a validator at `tcp://localhost:4004`
- start up the T&T processor with `./bin/track-and-trade-tp`
- setup and start the database and server:
    - `cd families/track_and_trade/server/`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run init`
    - `rethinkdb &` (requires port 8080 to be free)
    - `node index.js`
- setup and run the client:
    - `cd ../client/`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run build`

Now navigating your browser to `http://localhost:3000` should bring up a simple landing page with the existing forms. Using the signup form will allow you to create new users, and the login form will allow you to log in existing users. User information is stored in Local Storage which can be viewed in your browsers dev tools. Bring up dev tools with `cmd + option + i` and navigate to `Application > Storage > Local Storage`.

Changes should also be reflected in the database, which can be viewed by navigating your browser to `http://localhost:8080/#dataexplorer`. You can use the command`r.db('tnt').table('users')` to list all users, and the command `r.db('tnt').table('agents')` to see the Agents in the blockchain.",['delventhalz'],13,2017-09-15 20:59:17,2017-09-18 17:57:56,2017-09-18 17:57:56,True,2017-09-18 17:57:56,delventhalz,dirty,False,closed

Also the yaml scheduler state assertions must be relaxed because a txn may be replayed and then failed-fast leaving in the yaml scheduler tester the state of the prior txn.

Adds a process to the T&T Server which will listen for Track and Trade state changes on the blockchain, and sync those with the Rethink database. Deltas are maintained by storing multiple versions of each document with a `startBlockNum` and an `endBlockNum`. This allows older versions of documents to be queried, as well as making it possible to walk back forks when they occur.

This closes [#STL-626](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-626).

## Steps to Test

This PR is not particularly easy to test, but if you were going to try to, you would:
- Start up a validator
- Start up a REST API (must be on a port other than `8080`)
- Start up the T&T Transaction Processor
- Start up the T&T Server and RethinkDB:
    - cd `families/track_and_trade_server`
    - Make sure you `npm install` and `npm run init`
    - `npm start` (or `rethinkdb` and `nodemon index.js` in separate tabs if start is busted)
- Submit T&T Batches through the REST API . . . somehow (see below)
- Go to `http://localhost:8080/#dataexplorer` in your browser and watch as state magically appears in your database

### JS Testing Script

As of yet, there is no prescribed way to submitting batches to the processor. I used a fairly simple JS script, included below. If you save it in your `families/track_and_trade/server` directory you can run it from the command line by running `npm install request` and then running `node {script name}`. Each run submits one transaction, you can comment in/out whichever transaction payload you want to submit.

```
const request = require('request')
const {BatchEncoder, TransactionEncoder} = require('sawtooth-sdk')
const protos = require('./blockchain/protos')

  })

  // const payload = protos.TTPayload.create({

  //       intValue: 42
  //     })]
  //   })
  // })

  // const payload = protos.TTPayload.create({

  //       intValue: 64
  //     })]
  //   })
  // })

  const payloadBytes = protos.TTPayload.encode(payload).finish()
  console.log(payloadBytes)
  console.log(protos.TTPayload.decode(payloadBytes))

  const encoder = new TransactionEncoder(privateKey, {
    inputs: ['1c1108'],
    outputs: ['1c1108'],
    familyName: 'track_and_trade',
    familyVersion: '1.0',

  })

  const txn = encoder.create(payloadBytes)

  const batcher = new BatchEncoder(privateKey)
  const batchBytes = batcher.createEncoded(txn)

  request.post({

and the tests will fail:

        sawtooth admin keygen && \
        sawtooth keygen my_key && \
        sawtooth config genesis -k /root/.sawtooth/keys/my_key.priv && \

          --bind component:tcp://eth0:4004 \
          --bind network:tcp://eth0:8800 \

This commit fixes the tests to only check their specific namespaces so
that the tests will pass regardless of what the genesis batch is.

The fix here is quick and dirty. A more elegant approach would be to refactor both tests using the `RestClient` at `integration/sawtooth_integration/tests/integration_tools.py`.",['nick-drozd'],3,2017-08-31 22:59:07,2017-09-05 21:11:39,2017-10-09 17:43:22,True,2017-09-05 21:11:39,nick-drozd,unknown,,closed

This change adds a simple policy to poet to release counters
after a validator registration has exhausted its allowed
number of blocks published (k test).

The SGX enclave is also updated to throw an error if PoET
attempts to unseal signup data that references a defunct counter.

The block publisher now traps for that event to no longer use
that signup data and puts it into the condition where it seeks
to sign up again.

See Also STL-642 to add HW Counter simulation to poet simulator.
Broader poet core tests will be appropriate when that feature is added.

It ensures that only a single enclave can produce wait timers for a validator

certain errors. Instead it is best to pass the signup data into the two calls
which rely on the poet keys and hardware counter for security
(i.e. ecall_CreateWaitTimer and ecall_createWaitCertificate).

Which test failed? Apparently an intkey test, but which one? Python? Java? _Go_? Who knows? Currently the only way to tell is to dig through the docker output, which is very unpleasant.

This PR renames the test containers (that is, the docker containers that actually run the tests and report results) to match the names of their docker-compose files. It also does away with the `run_docker_test` `-s` flag, which makes it easier to use.

Here's what the test output looks like with these changes:

If solution is approved handling of TpPings will need to be added to all other sdks. 

A monitor socket is listening for disconnect events and notifies the executor that it should check all connected transaction processors to see if they are still connected. This is done by sending a TpPing response and waiting for a TpPingResponse is returned. If a transaction processor is found to not be connected, it should be removed from processors and all pending futures are set to an internal error (causing them to be rescheduled on a new processor).

The reasons that this ping message is needed, is that the zmq disconnect event only returns the following information: remote endpoint, event int, and a FD. I was not able to correlate a FD with a connection id for the transaction processor. Also a rest_api starts up/disconnects it creates the same type of connect/disconnect event as a transaction processor. 

Open issues I am looking for feed back on:
Currently, while waiting for the future to be set or a timeout to occur the executor thread is locked up waiting to know if a transaction processor should be removed. For example if the timeout is set to 10 seconds (the current timeout), and a processor crashes, it will take 10 seconds to continue processing.

sawtooth-core,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pulls/545,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/545,delventhalz,Add Basic Auth support to Sawtooth CLI,"# To Test This PR

This PR adds support for Basic Auth proxies. In order to test it, you'll need to build one. These are the instructions for setting up a simple authed Apache proxy in vagrant.

## Install Apache

```
% sudo apt-get update
% sudo apt-get install -y apache2
% sudo a2enmod headers
% sudo a2enmod proxy_http
```

## Set up a password file
```
% vi /tmp/.password
```

Edit the file to look like this:
```
sawtooth:$apr1$VHIPQ4Wi$k7PbIPqcfVp1NVKWhkIbS0

```

This saves the password `""sawtooth""` for the user `sawtooth`. You can generate new files like this at the site: http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/. However, the config file below only allows the user `sawtooth`, so that would need to be modified as well.

## Set up the site configuration

```
% sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

Edit the file to look like this:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin sawtooth@sawtooth
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        <Location />
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
                AuthType Basic
                AuthName ""Enter password""
                AuthUserFile ""/tmp/.password""
                Require user sawtooth
                Require all denied
        </Location>
</VirtualHost>

ProxyPass /sawtooth http://localhost:8080
ProxyPassReverse /sawtooth http://localhost:8080
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Path ""/sawtooth""
```

## Start and/or restart Apache

```
% sudo apachectl start
```

```
% sudo apachectl restart
```

## Make sure everything is set up properly

Start up a validator and the REST API normally. When you query the REST API, you should get back some block data as JSON:
```
% curl localhost:8080/blocks
```

You should also be able to get a `401` by querying the proxy without authorization:
```
% curl localhost/sawtooth/blocks
```

And finally, you should be able to get the same JSON by querying the proxy with authorization:
```
% curl localhost/sawtooth/blocks -u sawtooth:sawtooth
```

## Test the sawtooth CLI

With everything working above, you should be able to:
```
sawtooth blocks list --url http://localhost/sawtooth -u sawtooth:sawtooth
```

## What to do if you have permissioning issues around port 80

Sometimes vagrant seems to get angry when you try to run the proxy on port `80`. You can switch it to port `8000` by changing two files.
```
% sudo vi /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```

Switch `Listen 80` -> `Listen 8000`.

```
% sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

Switch `<VirtualHost *:80>` -> `<VirtualHost *:8000>`

Then:
```
% sudo apachectl restart
```

Afterwards the above example should work fine, but the proxy url will be `localhost:8000/sawtooth` instead of `localhost/sawtooth`.",['delventhalz'],2,2017-05-31 22:16:12,2017-06-04 03:17:54,2017-06-04 03:17:54,True,2017-06-04 03:17:54,delventhalz,unknown,,closed

The TransactionExecutor calls create_context on the context manager, passing in the inputs and outputs from the transaction as well as the context ids for transactions that this transaction depends on. Before this PR, each context holds all addresses and values (bytes) that has been an input up to that point as well as addresses and values that has been an output. This works in the serial case. In the parallel case, distinctions need to be made between whether the address was set in that context or was in that context and merely read from. Certain implementation decisions were made and I'll explain them here:
* Both create context and squash use breadth-first search. For create context, it is used to look back through the graph of contexts to find the values for addresses that are inputs for that context's transaction. For squash, the same, but at that point, if an address was never set in any context, it is never accessed.
* The SerialScheduler drops a lot of information, so that when the contexts need to be combined to make a new state hash or new context, only the context manager has the necessary information to combine contexts correctly and produce the correct state hash. The ParallelScheduler holds on to more information, where it would be possible and maybe desirable for the scheduler implementations to give the context manager all of the contexts that need to be combined at the end of processing, with an ordering that would be known to the scheduler.

NOTE: order is important in the `sawtooth admin genesis` command as the proposal to create `sawtooth.poet.report_public_key` (`config.batch`) has to appear before the validator registry transaction for the genesis validator (`poet_genesis.batch`) as the validator registry TP needs to be able to fetch the value when verifying the VR transaction.

Start up a config TP:
`tp_config -vv tcp://localhost:40000`

Start up a validator registry TP:
`tp_validator_registry -vv tcp://localhost:40000`

All three should start up successfully.  You can play around by setting `sawtooth.poet.report_public_key_pem` to a key that will result in the signature of the attestation verification report being invalid.  For example, `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and then use the `.pub` file from it in the above set of commands when bringing up the validator.","['jjason', 'agunde406']",6,2017-05-24 22:51:39,2017-05-26 15:31:51,2017-05-26 15:31:51,True,2017-05-26 15:31:51,jjason,unknown,,closed

verification outside of the core validator process, a
ProcessPoolExecutor execution strategy was chosen which uses
multiprocessing to fork and execute the signature verification
methods. Due to the extensive use of threading inside the
validator process, it is quite likely that a thread is inside
a critical section of logging code when the fork occurs. If
the signature verification code makes use of logging, the
logging call will deadlock on the release of the logging lock
inside the child process (because the thread holding the lock
is frozen inside the child process). This was leading to
intermittent failures during testing.

See http://bugs.python.org/issue6721

This change introduces a fix to this issue by replacing the
ProcessPoolExecutor with a ThreadPoolExecutor, ensuring the
calls run within the same process. This is intended to be a
short-term change, as it is still desirable to have the CPU
intensive signature verification work handled by a different
process.

This will cause TpProcessRequest to be re-sent if the response returned is an InternalError. If you only have on TP running against a validator, this will most likely cause the TpProcessRequest to be re-sent repeatedly forever. However, if you have two TPs running and one can handle the transaction, progress will still be made. 

To Test:
Add the following line to sdk/examples/intkey_python/sawtooth_intkey/processor/handler.py:
49    def apply(self, transaction, state):
50 +      raise InternalError('Test InternalError')
51          content = cbor.loads(transaction.payload)

Start up a validator 
Start up  tp_intkey_python 
Run intkey workload.

You should see the Internal Error repeat forever.

* if the new fork head is not a DevMode block, raises an exception
* if the current fork head is not a DevMode block and is the immediate predecessor to the new fork, it immediately accepts the new fork head as that indicates that consensus mode is changing
* if the current fork head is not a DevMode block and also is not the immediate predecessor to the new fork head, it raises an exception

Easiest way I found to test was manually (fingers crossed these instructions work) in multiple xterms:

Start up a validator:
```
sawtooth admin keygen --force
sawtooth config proposal create -k /home/ubuntu/sawtooth/keys/validator.wif sawtooth.consensus.algorithm=poet -o config.batch
poet genesis -k /home/ubuntu/sawtooth/keys/validator.wif -o poet.batch
sawtooth admin genesis config.batch poet.batch
validator -v --public-uri tcp://0.0.0.0:8800
```
Start up a validator registry TP:
```
tp_validator_registry -v tcp://localhost:40000
```
Start up a config TP:
```
tp_config -v tcp://localhost:40000
```
Start up REST API:
```
rest_api
````
Propose a config setting for DevMode consensus:
```
/sawtooth config proposal create -k /home/ubuntu/sawtooth/keys/validator.wif sawtooth.consensus.algorithm=devmode
```
Ensure that after you create the config proposal that in the validator log you see that the blockchain is udpated (you should see a message about the new fork head being chosen).  Depending upon the wait timer chosen by the PoET consensus module, this may take a minute or so (it is random after all).

Propose a config setting for PoET consensus:
```
/sawtooth config proposal create -k /home/ubuntu/sawtooth/keys/validator.wif sawtooth.consensus.algorithm=poet
```
Monitor the log for the validator - you should see a message when you propose the config setting `sawtooth.consensus.algorithm=poet` that DevMode has chosen the new fork head and it should also log a message that it detected a switch to DevMode consensus.

Repeat the propose Poet/propose DevMode several times.  You should see DevMode detecting the switch.

Then propose a config setting that does not switch consensus modes:
```
/sawtooth config proposal create -k /home/ubuntu/sawtooth/keys/validator.wif sawtooth.poet.target_wait_time=5
```
You should see DevMode fork resolver choose the new fork, but no message about detecting a change as it should be building upon a DevMode block.",['jjason'],1,2017-04-21 23:00:58,2017-04-25 20:26:53,2017-05-23 22:15:29,True,2017-04-25 20:26:53,jjason,unknown,,closed

Specifically, when a validator generates its signup information it includes in the information a nonce, which is the block ID of the current head chain.  When validating the signup information is ""fresh"" other validators will look at the nonce and compare it to some number of previous blocks.  The number is configurable, but defaults to a delay of zero, meaning that the validator's signup information must be committed in the block immediately after the block referenced in the nonce.  This test can be relaxed by increasing the allowed delay.

Updates in this PR include:
* Adds some unit tests for the different PoET policies
* Updates the signup information in the valiator registry for the nonce, removing commented-out tests and code that no longer is necessary in the PoET simulator or validator registry transaction processor
* Updates the PoET config view to have a configuration setting to configure the maximum amount of signup commit delay allowed
* Updates the PoET consensus state to make the check of the signup information
* Updates the PoET block verifier to ensure signup information for a validator claiming a block passes the new check
* Updates the PoET block publisher to make the signup info check before initializing a block.  If the check fails, the PoET block publisher will attempt to sign up again

It completes the transition from the 0-7-based architecture/implementation to the new 0-8 architecture.  This PR:
* adds the remaining generic PoET configuration settings (target wait time, et al) to the PoET configuration view, updates the PoET configuration view to cache values so it doesn't have to re-fetch them (as the state view is read-only and they cannot change for the particular instantiation of the PoET configuration view), and adds unit tests for checking them
* removes the `sawtooth.poet.fixed_duration_count` setting as it is redundant because of `sawtooth.poet.population_estimate_sample_size` and also brings code closer to spec (spec does not define a separate fixed duration count and instead has defined the population estimate sample size as the fixed duration count)
* updates the PoET enclave factory to use the PoET configuration view instead of directlying using the more-generic configuration view
* pulls the computation of the local mean inside the consensus state object, which includes encapsulating the keeping and updating of population samples within the consensus object
* updates the wait timer (when creating) and wait certificate (when validating) to use the consensus state for computing the local mean as well as removing the prior implementation of this in the WaitTimer class

1.  If neither block is a PoET block, bail out.
2.  Otherwise, if one block is a PoET block and the other isn't, then the PoET block is chosen.
3.  Otherwise (both blocks are PoET blocks), if the blocks share the same immediate predecessor block, the one with the smaller wait duration is chosen.
4.  Otherwise (they have different predecessor blocks), the one with the greater aggregated local mean is chosen.
5.  Otherwise,  the one with the lexicographically greater block identifier (header signature) is chosen.

Criteria 1, 2, and 5 were added because prior to 0-8, non-PoET blocks were not a possibility.

In addition, the code has been refactored to better encapsulate the consensus state statistics and information used to make decision.

This PR updates:
* adds a fixed duration block count property to the PoET configuration view.  This value indicates the number of blocks which will have their local mean computed by using a simple ratio of target to initial wait times.  These blocks are not considered when performing the zTest.
* updates the PoET enclave factory to use the new PoET configuration view's fixed duration block count property.
* refactors existing PoET policy tests (key block claim limit, block claim delay) to common utils
* adds minimum win count and maximum win deviation properties to the PoET configuration view.  These values are used when performing the zTest.  The minimum win count is that minimum number of blocks, after the fixed duration block count has been surpassed, a validator has to win before zTest will apply to any further blocks.  The maximum win deviation is used to determine if a validator has violated the zTest policy by comparing this against the deviation from the expected number of blocks a validator should have won.
* adds aggregate local mean to the consensus state, properly updates it when blocks are committed, and updates fork resolution based upon steps outlined previously
* most of the code in the common utils has been refactored to live inside the consensus state class to better encapsulate it
* as a side effect of the refactoring, all consensus state properties are now read-only as the refactoring allowed for updating of properties to always take place inside of consensus state object methods

2) Update the block publisher to have a batch limit per block, to allow for block sizes to be controlled. 

3) Checks for duplicate transactions in batches. Look in the current chain and CandidateBlock to make sure that any transaction in a batch added has not been previously committed to the chain.

If it is determined that allowing a validator to win an election (i.e., claim a block and have it added to the blockchain) would cause it to claim blocks more frequently than a configurable statistical rate, the block is rejected.

This PR updates:
* adds a fixed duration block count property to the PoET configuration view.  This value indicates the number of blocks which will have their local mean computed by using a simple ratio of target to initial wait times.  These blocks are not considered when performing the zTest.
* updates the PoET enclave factory to use the new PoET configuration view's fixed duration block count property.
* refactors existing PoET policy tests (key block claim limit, block claim delay) to common utils
* adds minimum win count and maximum win deviation properties to the PoET configuration view.  These values are used when performing the zTest.  The minimum win count is that minimum number of blocks, after the fixed duration block count has been surpassed, a validator has to win before zTest will apply to any further blocks.  The maximum win deviation is used to determine if a validator has violated the zTest policy by comparing this against the deviation from the expected number of blocks a validator should have won.
* updates the PoET block verifier to ensure that when verifying blocks it checks to make sure a validator is throttled by the block claim frequency allowed 
* updates the PoET block publisher to refuse to initialize a block if the block frequency check fails, indicating that other validators would reject the block
* removes the expected block claim count from the per-block consensus state as it is not necessary
* adds a short-circuit for blocks upon which block publisher has already determined it would not be allowed to build on top of

To test locally:
 `cd /project/sawtooth-core/integration/sawtooth_integration/docker` 

In `poet-smoke.yaml`, after the line:
`sawtooth.consensus.algorithm=poet \`

Add:

This should increase the chance of validators refusing the publish blocks because it would violate the block claim frequency test.  You can look at the logs for error log messages.

To reduce the likelihood of zTest failures, you can change `sawtooth.poet.ztest_maximum_win_deviation`.  The values are based upon the confidence interval (i.e., how confident we are that we have truly detected a validator winning at a frequency we consider too frequent):

* PoET consensus state statistics are now reset whenever a non-PoET block is encountered in the chain and the sealed signup data is removed from the consensus state as that needs to be maintained on a per-PoET public key basis.
* A utility class to manage and persist locally on a validator key state for its PoET key.  This includes the sealed signup data associated with it as well as whether or not it has been refreshed because the block claim limit has been reached with that key.
* The PoET genesis CLI and block publisher have been changed to use the PoET key state store for sealed signup data.
* A utility class to query PoET configuration settings.
* The PoET block verifier now enforces the key block claim limit when determining the validity of a block.
* The PoET block publisher abides by the key block claim limit when being asked to initialize a block.  If the limit has been reached with its current key, it will fail to initialize the block and if appropriate will create and register new signup information.

This differs from the existing `--network-endpoint`, as `--network-endpoint` describes the interfaces and port binding configuration on the local machine.

This also introduces the optional `--peering` argument, which takes `static` and `dynamic` as arguments. `static` is the default behavior if `--peering` is not supplied. In `static` peering mode, the validator will attempt to peer with endpoints provided in the `--peers` list. Notably, the first validator to start will not attempt to peer with any other nodes in this mode, and will accept peering requests from others. In `dynamic` mode, the validator will honor peering attempts with the `--peers` list and it will connect with listed endpoints provided to `--join`. Upon successful connection, it will request a connected peers list and then attempt to build up to a minimum connectivity threshold via successive peering attempts against random members of the collected list.

1. Breaks up the sawtooth-build-ubuntu-xenial docker image into separate images for building python, building debs, and building docs.
2. Makes the python build process match the java and javascript build process. Standardizing the build process across different languages is important for establishing a pattern we can repeat for adding more languages to the SDK in the future.
3. Reorganizes and improves the control of the build_all and run_tests script to make developing for a specific language easier.
4. Adds building external debs to the build process for python sawtooth packages, in preparation of publishing sawtooth debs.

I have created a google doc to support (3) which I will post a link to in the morning.

Specifically it:
* Uses pre-canned sealed signup information for the genesis block until the genesis utility seeds the chain with signup information for the initial validator
* Each validator creates signup information and registers it with the validator registry.  This is done every time the validator starts up.  Once consensus state is implemented, the sealed signup data will be persisted across invocations so that a validator may reconstitute the PoET enclave.
* Creates wait timers and wait certificates appropriately during initialize_block and finalize_block, respectively.
* The block verifier will automatically allow blocks to pass until there is at least one validator in the validator registry.  This will remain in effect until the genesis utility seeds the genesis block with the initial validator signup information.
* The block verifier currently ignores the wait certificate's check_valid results because of a race condition in the updating of the block chain resulting in incorrect local means being calculated for the wait timers (and therefore resulting wait certificates).
* A PoET enclave factory was added because the consensus object is no longer long-lived and need a way to implement singleton pattern for PoET enclaves as there should ever only be one running and it should not be continuously shut down and brought up.
* All PoET objects (SignupInfo, WaitTimer, and WaitCertificate) have been updated to accept a PoET enclave module for all methods that need it instead of keeping a class variable.

This version does not:
* Do proper fork resolution - it always just chooses the fork with the chain head with the highest block number.
* Implement the C, K, and zTest policies as that requires that consensus state be implemented.

To test, start up both the config and validator registry transaction processors (assuming starting in sawtooth-core):

`./bin/tp_config -v tcp://localhost:40000`
`./bin/tp_validator_registry -v tcp://localhost:40000`

Create a configuration transaction to set the consensus algorithm to PoET, create the genesis block, and start the validator:

`rm ~/sawtooth/data/*`
`./bin/sawtooth keygen`
`./bin/sawtooth config set -k <key_file_just_created> sawtooth.consensus.algorithm=poet sawtooth.poet.target_wait_time=5 sawtooth.poet.minimum_wait_time=1`

Define Handler implementations and then add them to the dispatcher. For a message that comes in that is not a response, the handlers are run in order asynchronously, with the possibility that any given handler can fail the message and the message is dropped. This could be for signature verification, for example. An implementation detail that seems to be an improvement is that when you add the handler you get to pick the concurrent.futures.Executor instance to run that handler in. For signature verification I have chosen a ProcessPoolExecutor with 3 processes, which speeds up signature verification.",[],16,2017-02-08 15:53:59,2017-02-09 03:30:46,2018-03-15 14:58:55,True,2017-02-09 03:30:46,rbuysse,unknown,,closed

into one (DRY) place. This should make it easier to maintain the list
since there is only one place where they are specified.

The different Sawtooth packages should now correctly specify their own dependencies
which means that with this patch using `pip install -e .` or `python setup.py
develop` should also work correctly.

For example using the following `requirements.txt` placed in `sawtooth-core` as `requirements-dev-venv.txt`:

```
-e core/
-e validator/
-e extensions/mktplace
-e extensions/arcade
```

Sawtooth will install in a virtualenv on OSX.

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements-dev-venv.txt
```

Passing the tests
