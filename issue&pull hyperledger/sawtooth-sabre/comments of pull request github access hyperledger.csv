https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/pull/20,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/pull/20,"Thanks for looking into the PR @rbuysse . I'll push another commit that changes the image for shell instead of moving the volume, and we can see how it looks.

To motivate it: one goal was to realign the two docker-compose files (default and installed) and be able to run the tutorial by swapping the docker-compose files when starting the network, one benefit being to shortcircuit the various cargo builds at startup https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/releases/latest/application_developer_guide.html#starting-the-network
then all the sections of the tutorial to do cr, upload, ns, and perm, that are preconditioned with  ""Enter the sabre-cli docker container"" would still work as is, that's why I put the volumes in the sabre-cli, and not shell.
Looking at the PR again, to follow through the original motivation, I would base the shell container not on `cli/Dockerfile-installed` but on `hyperledger/sawtooth-all:1.0` like in the docker-compose.yml. That would be one more realignment. In the tutorial, the shell container is only used for intkey related commands, so sawtooth-all is sufficient for that.
The added volumes to the `validator` and `sabre-cli` are for sharing the keys between containers. I noticed the docker-compose-installed.yaml was free of any volumes and this PR breaks this property, and could not tell if there was a best way to break it or not.

https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/pull/20,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/pull/20,"This note has important information that clarifies the two sets of inputs/outputs, but the current wording is confusing because of ""above"", ""remainder of this section"" and mentioning different actions.  I have several suggestions:

1. Remove the first ""above"" from ""The inputs/outputs explained above.."".  Reason: the word ""above"" can be understood as higher up than the immediately preceding info - i.e., _not_ the transaction-related inputs/outputs.

2. Delete ""In the remainder of this Section"" and describe only CreateContractAction in this note. Reason: Only one other action has these ""contract"" inputs/outputs (ExecuteContractAction), but it is slightly different so this note doesn't apply to both actions.

3. Clarify that the CreateContractAction inputs/outputs are used to enforce namespace permissions for the contract.

4. Delete the entire ExecuteContractAction sentence. Reason: The information about ExecuteContractAction is not exactly correct, and it is confusing because it occurs in the CreateContractAction description.  

In summary, applying these four changes results in the following wording for this note:

     These inputs/outputs are for the general Sawtooth transaction. 
     They are required for any transaction, whether it is a Sabre 
     transaction or a transaction of any other transaction family. 
     However, the inputs/outputs fields in the ``CreateContractAction``,
