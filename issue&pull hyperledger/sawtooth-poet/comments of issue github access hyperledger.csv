Still, though it is easier than it was, the commit messages do not attempt to explain the reasoning for the changes, and it can not be easily inferred.

For example, in this commit:

commit f6145a2ac23cd8c2c60e3db197024e94b6e5ab4b
Author: Rajeev Ranjan <rajeev2.ranjan@intel.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 15 14:11:53 2018 +0530

    UTs for ConsensusStateStore & lmdb

    Updations in lmdb.rs. Implement new uts in ConsensusStateStore.

    Signed-off-by: Rajeev Ranjan <rajeev2.ranjan@intel.com>

It is not clear the purpose of these changes. Since this change in particular is a change to a file copied from sawtooth-core, I'm curious about the reasoning. Good explanation in the commit message would help. (See https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
