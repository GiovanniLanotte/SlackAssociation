Just throwing some ideas out there to better manage state and reduce the complexity involved with making multiple API calls from the different components (which also slows down the performance of the app).

* Store user's collection in one place (can be reused when viewing own collection or with `<BreedDropDownMenu/>`)
* Store user's public key and private key via `Context` API

And

* Just render `parseDna` as soon as it's available instead of worrying about whether its sire indicator should appear or not yet (also don't worrying about bad dna; parsing DNA will always work!)
* If fetching information for a whole collection, also fetch details about the moji in the collection (but only fetch details about the collection's sire **once**?)
* If fetching information for a list of sires, you already have details about the moji in the random list (so **don't** fetch details about each moji's collection's sire)
* If fetching information for a list of random moji, also fetch details about the moji in the random list (and also fetch details about each moji's collection's sire)

---

Alternatively,

1. Don't fetch information about sires until all moji info has been fetched
2. Determine the collections that the moji belong to
3. Only fetch sire details for those collections
4. Go through entire list of moji and set their `isSire` prop to true (maybe show a ""pending"" icon in the meantime)

This PR includes two scripts.

- _bin/problemify_: modifies the code in place, turning it either into solution code or problem code
- _bin/publish_: pulls the latest commits from `upstream staging`, and pushes problemified versions to `upstream master` and `upstream solution`

The basic workflow is this:
- Once This PR is merged, I will create solution and staging branches upstream
- All future PRs will be made against staging, not master
- Include problemify-style comments in your code to designate solution vs problem sections
- Periodically (such as after merging new PRs into staging) run `bin/publish`

Problemify syntax:
```javascript
/* SOLUTION FILE */
const fs = require('fs');
...
```
^ This entire file should _only_ be included in the solution branch. It will be deleted from master. The opposite (though probably not useful) is `/* PROBLEM FILE */`.

```javascript
const hello = name => {
  /* START PROBLEM
  // Your code here

  END PROBLEM */
  // START SOLUTION
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  // END SOLUTION
};
```

^ This function will be empty save a comment (""Your code here"") on master, and completed on solution. Note that _all_ of the problemify syntax comments will be deleted from both branches.

Also note that this script errs on the side of caution. You most enter these comments exactly as written above (all caps) or they will be missed.

Closes #76 

Another big PR. No real functional changes, but a lot of structural ones:
- docstrings are everywhere, and in more or less their final state
- there are problemify-style solution/problem comments throughout
- processor utils are now ""services"", and there is no generic ""helpers"" or ""constants""
- added tests for the processor services
-the solution code has been rejiggered a bit to be more straight forward for students, especially in the processor

A big PR. The soul of the original part-one code is still there, but much of the actual code has been shuffled around. This includes some quality-of-life improvements like expanding docstrings, tweaking tests, etc, but also includes some major functionality changes:

- part-one now has a signing module
- the signing module for both parts use the `secp256k1` module directly as Sawtooth signing SDK is a little convoluted, and we don't want to introduce it in part-one (the the modules should match)
- transactions now get signed
- all validation functionality has been moved to a separate module
- all mining functionality has been moved to a separate extra credit module

One notable thing _not_ in this PR: an updated README for part-one. These will be updated once the learning materials are finalized.

Modify `code/part-two/client/source/services/transactions.js`:
- Replace `import` with `const`
- Replace `from 'XXXX';` with `= require('XXXX');`
- Remove `export`
- Add `module.exports = { createKeys, getSubmitter };`

Now, in a separate terminal run:
```bash
curl localhost:8000/api/state

Adds two modules to assist the client in interacting with the Sawtooth blockchain:

## services/requests

Includes four methods for fetching state. Each operates in a vaguely RESTful manner, retrieving all resources if no identifier is passed in, or one specific resource if there is an id. All are Promise based.

### Methods:

#### getCollections

- **getCollections()** - fetch all collections
- **getCollections(publicKey)** - fetch one collection

#### getMoji

- **getMoji()** - fetch all moji
- **getMoji(address)** - fetch one moji
- **getMoji({ owner: publicKey })** - fetch all moji owned by one collection
- **getMoji({ owner: publicKey, dna: dnaString })** - fetch one moji

#### getOffers

- **getOffers()** - fetch all offers
- **getOffers(address)** - fetch one offers
- **getOffers({ owner: publicKey })** - fetch all offers owned by one collection
- **getOffers({ owner: publicKey, moji: [addressesOrDna] })** - fetch one offer

#### getSires

- **getSires()** - fetch all sires (returns whole moji, not just address)
- **getSires(publicKey)** - fetch the sire belonging to a particular owner

## services/transactions

Has three methods which can be used to build and submit transactions.

### Methods

#### createKeys()

Creates a new private/public key pair, and returns them in an object with the keys `privateKey` and `publicKey`. Both are represented as hexadecimal strings.

#### getPublicKey(privateKey)

Takes a private key as a hex string, and returns its public key, also as a hex string.

#### getSubmitter(privateKey)

Takes a private key and returns a function which can be used to submit transactions. This function accepts two parameters. First, the payload or payloads you are going to submit (an object or an array of objects). The second is an optional boolean, specifying whether the returned Promise should wait to resolve until the transaction(s) are committed. It defaults to true.

### Example

```javascript
const { privateKey, publicKey } = transactions.createKeys();

const submit = transactions.getSubmitter(privateKey);

submit({ action: 'CREATE_COLLECTION' })
  .then(() => requests.getCollections(publicKey)
  .then(myCollection => console.log(myCollection)
```

## Testing

I am not entirely sure how ES6 modules get plugged into the front end yet, so there is probably an easier way to test it, but I tested these files with Node. This required making some modifications:

- `import XXXX from YYYY;` -> `const XXXX = require(YYYY);`
- `api/XXXX` -> `http://localhost:8000/api/XXXX`
- `export` -> delete 
- add all exported functions to Node exports: `module.exports = { XXXX, YYYY };`

Once you make those swaps, you can:

```bash
cd code/part-two/
docker-compose up --build
```

Then in a new tab:

```bash
cd client/
npm install
node
```

Then from the node console:

```javascript
const requests = require('./source/services/requests');
const transactions = require('./source/services/transactions');
```

Then you can mess around with the two services to your heart's content. Keep in mind you won't be able to successfully send any transactions other than create collection, or fetch any data other than collections because the TP doesn't have those features yet. Once PR #37 is merged, you will be able to fetch Moji data as well.",closed,True,2018-04-07 13:48:57,2018-09-14 15:49:11

* You can ONLY see a collection or ONLY see the details of a moji, but not BOTH at the same time. Why? Just to keep the code & cognitive overhead easier/simpler.
* `<MojiDetails />` component has been renamed to `<Moji />`.
* `<Browse />` component has been created, and it determines whether `<Collection />` component or `<Moji />` component is rendered. (It will soon have the option to display the upcoming `<Offer />` component.

What works so far (all with dummy data):

* User types in a collection address and sees a list of moji addresses that belong to that collection.
* User clicks on a moji address and sees all available information about that specific moji.
* User refreshes/closes-and-reopens the browser at the URL they're at when they're browsing the dummy data collection and mojis, and they will return to the same rendered view.

The dependencies currently installed are:

* React 16.3
* React Router 4.2.2
* Webpack 4

Some more details:

* React Router v4 `<HashRouter>` is currently used instead of `<BrowserRouter>` as `live-server`'s refreshes were resulting in 404 (?) errors with `<BrowserRouter>`. Everything works fine with `<HashRouter>`.
* Redux is not being used yet.
* Webpack 4 is set up with a bare minimal configuration.

education-cryptomoji,delventhalz,https://github.com/hyperledger/education-cryptomoji/pull/32,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/education-cryptomoji/issues/32,Add Create Collection to TP w/tests,"The TP now handles its first action: `CREATE_COLLECTION`. This can be tested with the included unit tests, run from `code/part-two/processor/` by using the command:
```
`npm test`
```

Closes #10 

----------

A full integration test is a little tougher. Nothing automated yet, maybe not ever (would be Docker based, perhaps not HR friendly). It can be done manually, but it's not for the faint of heart. Read on if you want to put your transaction processor through to the test for realsies.

From the `code/part-two` directory, start up the docker components:
```
docker-compose up
```

Now navigate to the `processor/` directory, and install the dependencies if you haven't already:
```
cd processor/
npm install
```

Now. Create a file called `submit.js`. It should look something like this:
```
'use strict';

const createHash = require('crypto').createHash;
const request = require('request');
const secp256k1 = require('sawtooth-sdk/signing/secp256k1');
const proto = require('sawtooth-sdk/protobuf');
const { FAMILY_NAME, FAMILY_VERSION, NAMESPACE } = require('./utils/constants');
const { encode } = require('./utils/helpers');

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8008/batches';
const context = new secp256k1.Secp256k1Context();
const privateKey = context.newRandomPrivateKey();
const publicKeyHex = context.getPublicKey(privateKey).asHex();

console.log('PUBLIC KEY:', publicKeyHex);

const createTxn = encodedPayload => {
  const header = proto.TransactionHeader.encode({
    signerPublicKey: publicKeyHex,
    batcherPublicKey: publicKeyHex,
    familyName: FAMILY_NAME,
    familyVersion: FAMILY_VERSION,
    inputs: [NAMESPACE],
    outputs: [NAMESPACE],
    nonce: (Math.random() * 10 ** 18).toString(36),
    payloadSha512: createHash('sha512').update(encodedPayload).digest('hex')
  }).finish();

  return proto.Transaction.create({
    header,
    payload: encodedPayload,
    headerSignature: context.sign(header, privateKey)
  });
};

const createBatch = txns => {
  if (!Array.isArray(txns)) txns = [ txns ];

  const header = proto.BatchHeader.encode({
    signerPublicKey: publicKeyHex,
    transactionIds: txns.map(txn => txn.headerSignature)
  }).finish();

  return proto.Batch.create({
    header,
    headerSignature: context.sign(header, privateKey),
    transactions: txns
  });
};

const encodeBatches = batches => {
  if (!Array.isArray(batches)) batches = [ batches ];
  return proto.BatchList.encode({ batches }).finish();
};

const postBatchList = batchList => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    request({
      url: API_URL,
      method: 'POST',
      body: batchList,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream' }
    }, (err, response) => {
      if (err) return reject(err);
      resolve(JSON.parse(response.body));
    });
  });
};

const submitPayload = payload => {
  const encoded = encode(payload);
  const txn = createTxn(encoded);
  const batch = createBatch(txn);
  const batchList = encodeBatches(batch);
  return postBatchList(batchList);
};

submitPayload({action: 'CREATE_COLLECTION'})
  .then(res => console.log('RESPONSE:\n', res))
  .catch(err => console.log('ERROR:\n', err));
```

Now install request, but don't save it:
```
npm install request --no-save
```

Run the script:
```
node submit.js
```

You should see a JSON response with a link. You can curl it:
```
curl http://localhost:8008/batch_statuses?id=fd9007b3f2896930281064b9445a61b7fe908707ff0f2b64ab87677ac342f91977c0ea5d167da8e8226281571eb79fce6845254650b8934c7c1abf09cbcb0477
```

You should see that the transaction is committed. You could also check state:
```
curl localhost:8008/state
```

You should see an entry with the `5f4d76` prefix in its address. For one final trick, copy the data, and start the node REPL:
```
node
```

And then copy and paste that data string into a Buffer to decode it:
```
Buffer.from(""eyJrZXkiOiIwMjZlMjRlOTNiZWVlYzE0MTgwOWZjMThhY2IxZTczZmQ0NDY1NGI0N2VjOTNiOGJjZmYxNDg5YmM4ZGU4MWI1N2QiLCJtb2ppIjpbXX0="", 'base64').toString()
```

You should see a JSON string with your public key and an empty moji array.",closed,True,2018-03-19 06:10:42,2018-09-14 15:49:13

The first six characters are reserved for an application namespace. In this case, we will use the first six characters of a SHA-512 hash of the application name, “cryptomoji”.

```

```

#### Resource Prefix

Next a one byte (two character) prefix follows which designates what sort of resource will follow:

- `00`: BlockInfo
- `01`: Collections
- `02`: Collection Resources (i.e cryptomoji and offers)
- `03`: Sire Listings

#### Block Number

The remaining 62 characters of a Block Info address is simply the hexadecimal representation of their block number.

education-cryptomoji,delventhalz,https://github.com/hyperledger/education-cryptomoji/issues/10,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/education-cryptomoji/issues/10,"TP: Build ""Hello World"" transaction processor","An initial version of the transaction processor that  can register with the Sawtooth Validator, and receive and correctly handle a CREATE_COLLECTION action. Should also include unit tests to confirm it works properly. Blocked by #9.

## Original Design

Essentially just used to register a public key in the app. Creates a new collection with the transaction signer’s public key and an empty set of cryptomoji.

### Requirements

- Signer’s public key must not already be registered

### Payload Schema

```
{
  ""action"": ""CREATE_COLLECTION""
}
```

### State Schema

```
{
  ""key"": <string, public key>,
  ""moji"": [ <strings, addresses> ]
}
```

### State Addressing

- `01`: Collections
- `02`: Collection Resources (i.e cryptomoji and offers)
- `03`: Sire Listings

#### Collection Hash

The final 62 characters of a collection’s address are the first 62 characters of a SHA-512 hash of the public key.
