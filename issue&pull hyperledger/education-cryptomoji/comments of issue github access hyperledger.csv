This PR is ready for review.

-----

### Viewing a Moji's Details

When viewing a nonsire that belongs to you, you have the option of selecting that moji as a sire (and upon a successful response from the server, will add a üé© emoji immediately to the moji's parsed DNA).

### Viewing a Collection

When viewing a collection, sires are noted by a different background color and a üé© emoji.

### Tradeoffs of Current Implementation

Currently, each `<MojiItem />` being rendered in a `<Collection />` makes its own AJAX call to determine if it's a sire or not. This is so that the `<MojiItem />` can be reused in other situations where moji are not strictly rendered in a collection (eg, listing all available sires, listing all moji to be traded in an offer, etc).",2018-06-26 03:40:07,2018-06-26 03:40:07

In general the guiding principle for future development will be to use current best practices, including ES6 syntax where applicable.

That said, in the absence of a clear best practice, erring towards readability for ES6 newbies should be the goal. A couple of instances still use ES5 syntax because the ES6 version was roughly equivalent, or actively less readable.

const { action } = payload;

Also, I believe in the final repo we will want stub prompt files to be in `master` while the answer files are in their own branch (`solution`?), under the same file name. I'm not sure what our workflow should be for getting to that point, but I think it probably makes sense to merge one file into `master` _with_ the solution code (and the prompt comment above the solution if you've written it). Then later once we have everything working, we can make a new branch and delete the solution code from `master`.",2018-03-07 21:25:28,2018-03-07 21:39:38
