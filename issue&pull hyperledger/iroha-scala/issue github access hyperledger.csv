iroha-scala,cimadai,https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-scala/pull/13,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/iroha-scala/issues/13,(+) Update Ed25519 usage for iroha v1.,"1. Changed ed25519 hash algorithm to SHA3-512.

SHA3EdDSAPrivateKeySpec is override class to use SHA3-512 as hash algorithm in Java8.

iroha v1 is change from SHA-512 to SHA3-512.

But it cannot get SHA3 instance by MessageDigest.getInstance in Java8.

And I didn't want to use Java9 because several dependencies.

So I created SHA3EdDSAPrivateKeySpec.

2. Updated proto files for iroha v1.

3. Updated validations for iroha v1.
