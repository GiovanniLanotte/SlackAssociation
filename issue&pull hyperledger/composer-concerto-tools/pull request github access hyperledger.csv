## Issue/User story

This fixes a circular dependency between Concerto and Concero-tools by moving Writer/FileWriter classes from the latter to the former.

## Design of the fix

In the latest versions, concerto-tools 0.50.7 depends on concerto 0.60 or later, which itself depends on concerto-tools 0.50.1, which creates confusion. Simply moving utility classes Writer and FileWriter from concerto-tools to concerto allows to avoid this circular dependency.

This also removes the unneeded dependency to the `moment` library.

## Validation of the fix

This has been tested against a version of concerto where the FileWriter and Writer classes have been moved. This WIP since the tests will only pass after a new version of Concerto has been published with the proposed changes.

## Automated Tests

All the existing tests are passing with no change and 100% coverage.

This PR:
 - adds getters/setters to the Java target (using options when calling the fields visitor)
 - makes Java fields private
 - adds a simple kind of plugin for the Java visitor to let users parameterize code-generation
 - removes the Corda target which can now be implemented using the provided plugin

A variant of the Corda target is expected to be provided in the Accord Project Cicero library.

## Issue/User story

This PR avoids duplication between alternative Java-based target formats (e.g., Corda and Java).

## Automated Tests

Testing is provided for default Java plugin (empty) and abstract plugin (raising errors).

## Issue/User story
I want to be able to generate Java classes ready for use in the Corda distributed ledger.

## Design of the fix
The current design is based on the Java target format, with a few simple changes to make the classes serialization according to Corda.

Rather than using options on the Java target, a Corda target allows for future changes (e.g., converting certain types such as dates, or monetary amounts to Corda classes).

## Automated Tests
All the Java tests have been ported for Corda.
