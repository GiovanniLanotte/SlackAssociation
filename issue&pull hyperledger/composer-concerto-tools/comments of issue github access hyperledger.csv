It adds annotations to the class declarations here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-concerto-tools/blob/86b2c28776c9406d420e36009cbdcfb7c50fdb9f/lib/codegen/fromcto/corda/cordavisitor.js#L214

And those depend on an additional import here:

https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-concerto-tools/blob/86b2c28776c9406d420e36009cbdcfb7c50fdb9f/lib/codegen/fromcto/corda/cordavisitor.js#L134

As a result, the generated Java classes will only compile as part of a Corda application.",2019-01-19 19:01:56,2019-01-19 19:01:56

- Adding constructors/accessors to the class
- Provide Corda-specific conversions for CTO types, notably `DateTime` and currency amounts, so they would be aligned with Corda-supported libraries
- Generate classes that implement Corda-specific interfaces (e.g., for Corda state)",2019-01-19 19:04:04,2019-01-19 19:04:04
