2. Also, identify the query that is called to fetch the count of matching users with same as given username in the Rethink Database. If not exists already create this query.
3. Identify a place where sounds logical to be implemented when POST API details are submitted to the corresponding table in database. Because, this is where we shall restrict that new data from being added if the username is NOT UNIQUE.
4. Introduce the error handling there to display - ""user already exists"" message.
5. Write the test case around this logic, if necessary.

Something about the way this PR is done has squashed it down to 1 commit, which is usually good, but in this case obfuscates what's changed and what's not changed. I know we want to keep a clean git history, but if there's a way to expose this going forward, that'd be great. 

EDIT: 
I forgot to say why. After looking through the changes in bulk, I don't have a great picture of what changed and how between the opening of the PR and the current state. The links to the files above all give 404s instead of showing how the code has changed. This almost necessitating a full re-review, as without reviewing additional changes as they come in, the review can't be thorough.

Doesn't address agreed upon work
Breaks encapsulation of the library by removing expected methods and requiring they be imported separately, and prevents them from being overridden on an object type basis.

I am investigating issues with the ingestion of ldap data. Something is resulting in the hash function attempting to hash non-String types.

This doesn't break encapsulation because the bottom-most function is static. Also, the function is never overridden. When I extracted it and wrote a unit test for it, I encountered roughly 600 test failures. We do not need 600 tests for a random id generator and SHA-256 encryptor.

Other than serving the purpose of troubleshooting a current issue, this PR shows how inflexible the code around ledger_sync has become. A change this small should only break one test, but instead, it sets off hundreds of alarms. So the real loss of time is not one person's inconvenience around a complicated merge, but instead the logarithmic effect on delivery due to tightly coupled design reinforced by hundreds of layers of tests.

It's ok if this code change doesn't get merged. I can continue the investigation on the branch, but need the code/tests to be more flexible in order to identify the root cause.

I also found some relief in fixing the spelling errors.  ",2018-12-19 18:31:22,2018-12-19 18:34:11

2) a regular user asks to be promoted to owner so he requests to be made an owner.  Current owner must approve.

In either case, once approval is received, they get added to the list of role owners.

  Connection timeouts -  read:10 sec,  connect: 6 sec, retry: 10 sec
  Inital syncs retry/warn every 10 seconds until connected
  Delta inbound opens a new connection for every iteration

There are initial & delta syncs as well as inbound & outbound syncs. The connections can fail in a number of ways for a number of reasons (eg: if auth fails, then there is no point in retrying since the creds come in on the env, so it makes sense to exit completely). 

I am adding a PR that wraps the outbound delta sync in a try/catch for session termination:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/pull/900

And am going to request that, if we open this defect again, we are specific about which sync fails (initial, delta)(inbound, outbound) and include steps to reproduce what you are experiencing. I would rather avoid wrapping in generic Exception because doing so risks any unrelated Exception causing an endless loop of non-deterministic effect.

1) Adjust the value of 'dSHeuristic' in Active Directory. This could result in unstable behavior by allowing excessive queries to interfere with other AD traffic on the network.
2) Implement paging on the ldap client. The precondition for this feature is that paging is enabled in TMO AD. I have reached out to @chrisspanton for confirmation and am adjusting our script to use paging now.

We discussed this briefly during an afternoon group review yesterday. A few topics/opinions shared:

Authoring custom assertion types: I've seen it done before. It isn't generally my thing, but when other people do it, it isn't an issue because it usually happens at a time when some folks are writing tests and others are not. Top priority is to get everybody writing tests for their changes regularly.
  - I try to keep assertions minimal and targeted specifically towards the result.
  - Custom assertions run the risk of enforcing aspects of the project that are still evolving. I have seen in the past assertions that expect http status, body, headers... fail when the endpoint changes. 

I try to keep unit tests as minimal/understandable as possible. That said: The details about what constitute well-crafted tests are a topic of opinion: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3258733/new-to-unit-testing-how-to-write-great-tests#3258768

Re: Dependencies: Relying on, and importing fixtures for more complex tests is a necessity lest you end up with redundant boilerplate. I prefer to do the lifecycle elements (server spin-up, db ddl, etc) in a ""before all tests"" step and, if possible, wrap each test in setup/teardown. If that proves to be more effort than using random data for each test object, then random data is preferred using a builder with random defaults and optional attribute overrides as necessary.

The standards we are trying to follow or those of the Linux Foundation. Another LF maintainer on this repo asked us explicitly not to squash unrelated commits together, and that multiple commits in a PR is fine.

PRs are separated if there are either two many files to review, they need to be reviewed separately, they are expected to be contentious, or it is likely they will need to be amended (as otherwise only the last commit is easily amended). None of that applies here.

- If permissions get taken away, do we still need to reauth or only if permissions get expanded?
- if permissions get removed, should we still notify all role members so they understand why something stopped working?

Actually, it looks like pipreqs mapped it from Crypto, and running `ack Crypto` shows:

```
transaction_creation/rbac_transaction_creation/common.py
23:from sawtooth_signing import CryptoFactory
43:    factory = CryptoFactory(sawtooth_signing.create_context(""secp256k1""))

22:from Crypto.Cipher import AES
(sawtooth) tm0493806:sawtooth-next-directory bobonana$

I think we should just add `sawtooth-rest-api*` to `--ignored-modules` in `./setup.cfg`. At that point we can prepend 
```
pykg-config==1.3.0
secp256k1==0.13.2

I can change the default docs folder to `./docs` but would it be more appropriate to close PR #201 and open a new one? sphinx uses `_static` for static doc pages `_templates` for templates and `_build` for the transpiled html pages. I know `./docs` is a standard way to store docs, but I also think we shouldn't stray too far from the Sphinx defaults. Would it be acceptable to use the default directories within `./docs`, for `./docs/_static`, `./docs/_templates`, and `./docs/_build`?

Important criteria for adding a maintainer is history with the project and a good working relationship with the other maintainers.

> looking at how to properly ignore these, it looks like some of our libraries may be dynamically generating some stuff, which is causing our linting errors both in pylint in in our IDEs. I'm going to ignore the rbac* and sawtooth* modules in pylint to get around this, which seems to be the recommended solution.


I think we have dynamic modules, etc. that are causing issues with Pylint. I think we need to either ignore them to prevent those false positives (as far as I can tell that is the recommended practice) or find another linter that will recognize dynamic modules. I don't think we can leave it as is, the false positives are causing too much noise in the lint report.

1. list all proposal types: add/remove role member,  add/remove role admin,  add/remove task admin, update user manager etc
2. for each type of proposal, list all possible PERSONAS that could be the approvers. ex. for role, we may need role owner/admin and the employee's manager  
3. enumerate those possible personas, and for each case, code how to fetch those persona's id from the payload. 

with those, we can put configurations like this on the database/chain. The config json should handle multi-party approval, hierarchical approval
