Justifying my change, we have several classes that adds logic to the object we are creating. For example, we want stuff to happen when it is created, or we need to perform some operations on it, or control how its displayed, etc. Dictionaries or tuples may not be the best to use in our case so I kept the classes, but set the minimum public methods to 0.

**Description**  This is the result set for the ""search"" box in the left hand pane of the app.  This search box is always visible and is context free so we need to show all possible matches (full or partial) to the given query.  Possible types of objects returned are as follows:
- person object -- where full name or email match the query string
- person object -- where person's manager matches the query string  
- role object -- where the role owner, role name or role description matches the query string
- pack object -- where the pack owner, pack name or pack description matches the query string


**Acceptance Criteria/Tests**  
- all possible results for a given query should be displayed in a single page.
- different types of results should be grouped together (with a section title maybe?)
- within each section, the results should be sorted into an obvious order (for example, search for all persons with the first name ""Patrick"" might sort by last name instead of by employee hire date. )
- performance of search query is a key factor here...  all results shown within XX units.
- each result type should be clickable and the user will be navigated to the logical place if they select one:
     - clicking a person object takes you to the People page, org chart view with that person selected (so their org shows on the right pane)
     - clicking a role or pack type takes you to the details pane for that object.

**Questions**: 
- Can we do this by firing off a group of parallel searches from the UI and consolidating the results or would it be more efficient to have one api that can return all results (tagged and sorted somehow so we know how to display them)
- what is the upper limit on response time for this to be useful?  If the user sees results populating as they are found, they might see the result they wanted before search completes....  could we do that with a backend search API?",closed,False,2019-03-07 19:37:30,2019-03-26 19:45:31

**Description**
There are a few scenarios where the requester and the approver are the same.  In those cases, Next should recognize this and automatically accept the proposal without requiring the approver to act.  
- when a role/pack creator adds members at creation time (requires on_behalf_of functionality)
- when role/pack creator asks to become a member of the role/pack that they own.

**Acceptance Criteria/Tests** 
- any scenario that would normally result in the approver being asked to accept/reject their own request should instead be auto-approved.
- since proposal are still being created and processed, the ledger should still show that a proposal was made and it was approved.
- no alerts get generated for such proposals

T-shirt size: S(mall), M(edium), L(arge):  M

**Description:**
Design the functionality around being able to act on a proposal on someone's behalf (to support DELEGATION and HIERARCHICAL approval features).  

**Requirements:**
1. actions taken on a proposal are correctly recorded to ledger when delegate/manager acts on them.
2. we don't record proposals that have expired during a delegation -- only those acted upon.
3.  UI will need to be able to reflect this information to user -- When Manager accepts on behalf of Approver, the UI can show this info in both the Manager's history and the Approver's history.
4. only needs to support ONE actor -- one person will be recorded as accepting or rejecting a proposal. However, anyone in the management chain can be the actor.  (see #1215 for hierarchical rules)  


**Acceptance Criteria**
- timeboxed work -- to be delivered in the first third of the sprint.
- Design review completed -- team understands and agrees on the design.
- work with the SM/PO to add the identified stories to the backlog.

Tasks

- [x] Research current state of on_behalf_of

- [x] Design a solution to include on_behalf_of within proposals and how it interacts with our APIs + UI, with PlantUML diagrams

- [x] Present ideas to team and receive feedback

----------|----------
Expected behavior | All users need to be updated for the delta inbound checks
Actual behavior | 1000 users are updated each time.
Build | Post Sprint 13 build
Severity | 2.  Blocks functionality

Repro steps
```
From backend:
1. log onto the server
2.  Look at the docker logs
3.  The ldap delta is only pulling 1000 users it should be pulling all of them.
From frontend:
1. Log into next.
2. Navigate to people
3. Wait for people to load > You will see a bunch of users with username listed
4.  Type 'Arthur' into the search bar > you will see a user that has display name shown instead of username
```

- [ ] Fix the fetch_ldap_data() in delta_inbound_sync to work more like the one in initial_inbound_sync.
- [ ] Update inbound_delta_sync as necessary to use fixed fetch_ldap_data()
- [ ] Test and validate that delta sync is working as expected.

T-shirt size:  | 
User Story |  ""As a user of Next, I want to alert my chosen delegate of their nomination as such via email so that they are prompted to drop what they are doing and quickly respond to my request""""
Description | Think iteratively...
- This message shall be text only -- no HTML (that can come later)
- The content of the message shall be pulled from the delegation setup form.  
     - recipient email 
     - start date
     - end date
     - outgoing message (if we have one when we tackle this story -- #1313 )
     - Count of roles?  List of roles?  
- messages shall be added to the queue (story #1308) but should be processed immediately since we don't have user preferences for delayed send yet. 

**Acceptance Criteria/Tests** 
1.  Basic text message with target content is sent to target recipient within 10 min of delegation setup 'Send' button being pressed.
2.  No 'Approve/reject' button on this message yet,  No deep link back into Next either.  The goal here is to pull content from a form, build a message , add it to the queue and process the queue.",closed,False,2019-02-27 21:58:15,2019-03-25 22:23:33

**Description**
The user story above is one scenario where this capability is needed.  Others might be ""co-worker helps new team member get up and running by generating proposals for them."" or ""HR/SysAdmin provisions new hire's accounts before they show up for first day of work.""  or ""I'm creating this new role/pack and I know all of my current team will need access to it so I add them at creation time""  Basically we need proposals that say ""UserA is requesting that UserB gets access to roleX.""  

**Acceptance Criteria/Tests**
- This story is to enable this type of proposal.  There are several use cases for it and those  UI stories will have dependency on this one.  
- ""NExtSystem"" should be a valid proposal creator -- for the use case listed above
- any module dealing with proposals needs to handle this type.  

Questions:  
- Does this idea of NextSystem creating proposals break SOX compliance at all?
- How should this show in the UI ?

- Summary info for each delegation includes the # of roles affected, the delegate's name and email, the start and end dates for the delegation. Also the current status of the delegation.
- status for delegations are

Description | ...
- proposals shall support 'on_behalf_of' functionality so that we can record that an action was done by a delegate for someone else.
- Even when a delegation is current, the role owner can still decide to act upon a proposal.  In this case, the ledger will show that 'approver took the action' just like it would if no delegation were in place (ie - doesn't show ""A acted on behalf of B who was acting on behalf of A""
- delegations begin and end at the specified time and dates.  Since the dates are inclusive it should be from midnight the day before start to midnight of the end date -- in current time zone.  (unless #1295 says we will let the owner pick date, time and time zone)
- proposals in the role owner's pending queue at the start of the delegation will be moved to delegate's pending queue.
- likewise, roles in the delegate's queue at the end of the delegation shall be moved back to the owner's queue.
- we need to record on the ledger what authority is used to allow this person to act on the proposal.  Was it through hierarchical?  through delegation?

- There is also an alert time for proposals -- how far in advance to trigger alerts that proposals are expiring to to escalate up the chain of command.  (even though escalation is V2, I think the concept of 'soon to expire proposals' is V1)

- pressing button takes user to next page to set up a new delegation. 
- ""Roles selection"" is greyed out -- all owned roles will be delegated for now.
- ""Delegate selection"" is done by entering email address of delegate for now.
- ""From/To"" are both required fields and can be done by calendar picker or direct entry.
- For now, delegation doesn't require acceptance on the part of delegate
- any proposal not acted upon by Delegate before it expires will show on the 'Expired' tab but will not show who let it expire. (requires #1296)
- To avoid confusion the approver shall choose date, time and time zone of delegation start and stop.

- verify that delegate can act upon the proposals -- Accept/Reject/Expire
- proposals are correctly written to the ledger with the correct 'on_behalf_of' data
- verify that proposals acted upon correctly show in the history tabs (both owner and delegate)

Description | We should be able to handle the situations where an approver is unexpectedly unavailable. V1 allows hierarchical approval of **proposals** but not things like editing roles/packs to change ownership or setting up/ extending/ending delegations.  For the short term, if someone leaves the org we can always get their passwords reset and give them to the manager so that they can log in as the owner and make these changes.  Perhaps the V2 feature of having a SysAdmin would take care of this issue.

----------|----------
T-shirt size:  | 
User Story | ...  This page intentionally left blank ...
Description |  NeXt has a built in policy that requests to extend access to a role shall require BOTH the role owner and the requester's manager to approve.  However, if the access expires, the requester can simply request access again it is treated like a new request (requiring only the role owner's approval)  How to deal with this...?  
Acceptance Criteria/Tests | 

related to #1230 

It seems that we have a very narrow path to get into this situation -- only when the Manager is not paying attention to pending proposals and it expires then his/her wishes are not considered with the subsequent request (to get access again)  

If the manager *is* paying attention and deals with the proposal before it expires we are fine.

This manager should be able to see this proposal in the list of expired proposals (in the Approver UI) so we have done everything we can to alert them and document what happened....

Do we want to try to build some logic into Next to catch this situation and prevent it?

- [ ] reauth requests will show on the user's tab even though the systems has generated them -- they are 'on_behalf_of' the current user'
- [ ] If one approver rejects, it shouldn't immediately close the proposal - it stays on this list until it expires or it gets two approvals (we are considering supporting the concept of changing one's mind on a proposal #1229)

- if the access duration time is shortened, existing roles are impacted immediately.  This will trigger reauth proposals.   Some roles  will likely  expire immediately and access will go away until the reauth is processed.
- any role that was expired under the previous access duration, shall stay expired even if the duration gets extended and would have extended their access.
- expiration of access is calculated from the approval date for the original proposal (or reauth approval).

----------|----------
T-shirt size default is Extra Large | XL
Description | This epic is to track the V2 functionality for Hierarchical approval.  Mostly we are trying to add escalation and alerting.
Business Need (the why): | Technology allowing approvals to automatically advance up the organizational chart as expiration date approaches (escalation)
Stakeholders |
Details | All the details needed to accomplish the story.
Questions |  1) do we log escalations to the ledger?  2) do proposals continue to escalate all the way up the org until someone takes a stand? -- if so, nothing will ever expire.  Should there be a configurable number of levels to escalate?

Acceptance Criteria
- After a pre-defined time (configurable) has been reached on a proposal, system shall automatically escalate approval request to the approver's next level up manager.
- escalation resets the proposal expiration time so the manager has the same amount of time to process before proposal goes stale again.
- proposals will continue to escalate up the org until someone takes an explicit action (approve/reject)
- each escalation shall trigger an email to the manager who now should take an action.
- each escalation shall cause an alert icon & alert task in Next for the manager
- each escalation shall trigger an email to the requester informing them of the new approver they should be pestering.
- role owner can review any approval done on their behalf and revoke them if they deem necessary.
- role owner can review any approval done on their behalf and confirm them, such a confirmation should be visible in the UI (think checkmark on approved list maybe) and written to the ledger

**User Story:**  ""As a user of a NExT, I don't want to need to monitor the pending expirations of my role access.  Reauth requests should happen automatically at a certain lead time before expiration.  This way I am focused on building killer features instead of looking at NEXT""

**Description**
 The idea of reducing the friction applies here...  we should strive to make things as smooth as possible for users.  Therefore, we automatically request a reauth of permissions.

**Acceptance Criteria/Tests**
- Demo that reauth proposals are generated when the user's access is due to expire minus the lead time. - I would suggest that the lead time we use is the same as proposal expire time.  
- The type of proposal to be generated is the one from #1304.  This work is related to that story but is not exactly blocked by it.

**Question** 
- currently we support a 'renew' button for users who see their access is expiring.  Doing both might generate duplicate proposals?  ",closed,False,2019-02-01 00:28:46,2019-03-25 20:21:01

----------|----------
T-shirt size:  |  L
User Story | ""As a user of NeXt browsing all available people & roles/packs is overwhelming, we should limit the results via search so I can find what I want.""
Description | enter a keyword to search by and I will see results where this term is in searched fields (below).
Acceptance Criteria/Tests |  Results should display as I type them...  the page will refresh and narrow down results in (near) real time.  It's OK if my search term is contained in a field that is not immediately visible in the results (ie if tiles dont show description, I still want to see that tile in the result set)   This first attempt at search will NOT include AND, OR NOT in the search functionality.  The main variations on Search are detailed below.


Requirements:
*Needs to be done, tested and available on the DEMO endpoint by morning of 2/14/19*
 
Backend REST API -- immediately set up to return mock data (or did we land on coding to an API??), will return actual data by 2/13
 
Real time results vs search button 
-- if we do 'search as you type' we need to also pass in the sort order we would like the results to be in…  sorting on the backend is preferred to sorting in the UI.  Results should be limited the result type (ie ""browse"" page search is limited to roles/packs as results)
 
Three main areas to enable search:
1.	Browse screen
a.	Search role/pack names - returns any role containing this string
b.	Search owner name
c.	Search owner email
d.	Search description text
2.	People screen 
a.	Search name
b.	Email,
c.	Job Title (Job title not returned by API yet -- later sprint)
d.	Manager name
e.	Manager email
3.	Broad search 
a.	Broad search (left hand pane) -- needs a new page for displaying results broken out by type of result.
i.	Roles/Packs -- title and description and owner email, owner name
ii.	People -- name and email and manager
iii.	People -- where we matched the person's manager -- implies we search the manager name in the org
 
The idea here is that this page would display any result type divided up by result type.  Ie enter ""chrisspanto"" and you see all packs and roles owned by Chris, the person object that *is* Chris and all the person objects that are Chris's direct reports.  All displayed in beautiful UI making it easy to find what I want.

-------------|------------
Bug | #1094
Description | Files in /rbac/server/api/* need to be rewritten to create and close a new connection object with rethinkDB per query/action instead of reusing the persistent connection object from the global namespace (`app.config.DB_CONN`). Or use the `reconnect` method of the connection object at the start of each action and continue to use the persistent connection from the global namespace [details](https://rethinkdb.com/api/python/reconnect/).  
Business Need (the why): | The persistent connection being passed into the global namespace is closed by rethinkDB after a period of time. This essentially breaks the app.

Expected behavior | Connections to rethinkDB should be created and closed once for each query and not persist within the application.
Actual behavior | A single persistent connection object is created and saved in the global namespace. After prolonged periods the connection is closed by rethinkDB, but rbac-server attempts to reuse the initial connection object from the global namespace. This leads to refused connections from rethinkDB which bubble up through the REST API as connectivity errors in the UI.

User Story | ""As a user of NEXT, I cannot remember what password I used and I need a reminder/reset so that I can get back into the system and do useful work.""
Acceptance Criteria/Tests | A valid user of NEXT can request a pw hint or reset without being logged into the system.  Once the request has been initiated, they should be able to recall/reset the PW within moments and get back to work.
Details/Questions | The acceptance criteria and description are intentionally vague to leave open possible options for implementation. 

- should this trigger an email with a link to a page where I can reset my password?
- should we have them store a hint when they create the pw and this process just email them their hint?
- should this trigger a pw reset and we send them a temporary pw that must be reset on first use?

Create took two optional params, object_id and related_id

having changed create to accept named key arguments, we
now need those key values for regular transaction parameters
in order to make proposal actions generic in the way the API
calls them. Thus, the new method only creates an object and
returns the status, and get should be called separately.

User Story | We should have a way to uniquely identify each build of our application.  This lets us communicate to our users in a definitive manner regarding functionality and bugs.


**Description**  : This can be implemented a number of ways...  an About box in the UI somewhere is one example.  Each automated build should be tagged with a unique number that follows a predictable pattern.  ~~""Major.minor.date.time"" is one such pattern but if our build system automatically generates one too then we could use that.~~ As per Dustin's suggestion we'll use the short hash of the most recent git commit (you can get this running `git describe --tags` in the repo). Useful information on setting up git tagging (which we haven't done yet) can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5694389/get-the-short-git-version-hash), [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging), and [here](https://coderwall.com/p/hwmmsq/sync-application-version-with-git-tag-automatically).

- [ ] Determine where the data is being queried from (formerly pseudo-relational tables, more recently 'state')
- [ ] Add support to the endpoint for limiting the range of results ( query params )
- [ ] Write the query that filters on the given range params

Acceptance criteria: 
- Demo in the UI. If the feature is not available in the UI, demo using a rest client.
- Given a GET request to a lookup endpoint having a specified page length, the api should yield a list of results that is less than or equal to the specified page length. If results = 12, page size is 10, then page 1 should have 10 results.
- The api should be able to show traversal across several pages. If results = 50, page size is 8, then the call for page 2 should return (considering base index of 1) results in 9-16.
- Traversals should stop at either end of the list without breaking. If results = 15, page size is 10, then page 2 should have 5 results and traverse no further.
- Paging should be stateless. Any lookup of any range of results should be available in the api at all times. Any and all state management must happen in the UI.

User Story | ""As an Approver in NEXT, I want to be able to respond approval requests directly in the email message I receive to approve or reject a request without opening the NEXT client.  This allows me to respond to approvals in a timely manner.""

**Description** 
- Any email notification requiring action on the recipient's part should include the appropriate response buttons.
- pressing the buttons in the mail registers the response with NexT application the same as it would if the response had been made via the UI
- The types of emails that will use this feature include (but not limited to)
     - Singleton approval requests
     - delegation requests

Question: 
- what do we do for summarized access request emails?  When reauth season kicks off, I would rather get one mail with 15 requests than get 15 emails with one request each.  Will the email have the capability of selecting a subset of the requests and approving?  Maybe the right thing for such emails is to have APPROVE ALL, REJECT ALL buttons and direct the recipient to the client UI if they wish to make subset selections.
- Are the buttons disabled somehow once I have responded the first time?  Should a response somehow move the mail to the deleted items folder (like meeting requests in Outlook?)

**Acceptance Criteria/Tests**
- For the given email requests above, user shall be able to respond by selecting the buttons in the UI.
- reopening the mail and responding in a different way is the same as story #1229 -- it records a second response that supersedes the first one.
- demonstrate that this functionality works with top 5 most popular corporate email clients (as well as on devices)",closed,False,2018-12-10 22:59:15,2019-03-25 22:30:36

The 2 Eventhub instances in the namespace were deleted, so we need to create 2 new Eventhub instances within the old namespace. They were deleted because the account was a demo account with a trial period that expired.

[Understand the Rasa Stack](https://rasa.com/docs/get_started_step1/)

> The Rasa Stack is a framework to build contextual AI assistants and chatbots. It consists of two open source libraries (Rasa NLU and Rasa Core).

[NLU](https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/)

> Rasa NLU is an open-source natural language processing tool for intent classification and entity extraction in chatbots. For example, taking a sentence like

[Architecture](https://rasa.com/docs/core/architecture/)

## In this PR:
- Add Docker service based on Rasa Core from `rasa/rasa_core:0.12.2`
- Add WebSocket route to server for handling chatbot requests
- Add NLU language processor
- Add script to train Core and NLU
- Add initial training data

## Gist:
- `bin/train` trains Core and NLU from documents in `/chatbot`
- Core server waits for incoming requests on port 5005
- JS client sends message payload to `/api/chatbot` over `ws://` as serialized JSON
- REST server POSTs to Core server, providing it conversational context via user ID
- Core server replies with chatbot response `->` REST server responds `->` Client displays view

## Notes:
- Client changes not included

## Todo:
- Conversations exist in memory. Create adapter for Rethink.
- REST auth middleware doesn't yet use token from socket handshake

Description | The default docker-compose misnamed the images as production. Production images will be on DockerHub, not pulled from GitHub. An addition dev docker-compose file added volume mounts for developers, so they can modify files locally and have those reflected in the containers without a rebuild. Apparently the that rebuild process was confusing people, so it has been dropped, and there is now only one mode (that with docker volume mounts).

Renamed tmobile-rbac to hyperledger-rbac as the working
directory name. Run bin/clean to remove pycache directories
that may otherwise cause an error.

bin/clean will also suggest pruning all existing docker
images. That is optional but recommended.

bin/start, bin/start -d and docker-compose up are equivalent.
still use the -b flag as --build or -p flag for persistent
data on bin/start.

Terming into the containers shows the old tmobile working path.
This may be cached somewhere else, cd .. && cd hyperledger-rbac

User Story | ""As an administrator of the NEXT platform implementing NEXT into my organization, I want to have the ability to export my organization's NEXT data (users and groups) into AAD. I need the data to be on the platform to perform RBAC duties""
Description | A NEXT outbound queue is needed to allow organizations to integrate their users and groups created on the NEXT platform with their AAD installation. The sync will be a delta sync and will be used to grab any differences in NEXT from the last outbound sync queued up in a RethinkDB table called ad_inbound_queue to be exported to AAD. Differences consist of changes to Users or Groups made within NEXT.
Business Need (the why): | To allow for organizations to easily adopt the NEXT platform for their RBAC management, the platform should include an option to export users and groups to AAD. This outbound queue will store all the records from NEXT before it gets saved in AAD.
Details | AAD Delta Outbound Sync, New Outbound Queue table RethinkDB
Acceptance Criteria/Tests | 1) Have a new RethinkDB table called ad_outbound_queue 2) Delta sync function to grab differences in Next data from last sync from ad_outbound_queue, write them to AAD, and add them to ad_outbound_queue.completed. May still need UAT or SIT / integration testing with other stories.
Failure | Not all data records from NEXT were imported to ad_outbound_queue
Definition of Done | Sync reflects the latest version of NEXT data from the ad_outbound_queue table and adds that data to AAD.

User Story | ""As an administrator of the NEXT platform implementing NEXT into my organization, I want to have the ability to import my organization's Active Directory data (users and groups) into NEXT. I need the data to be on the platform to perform RBAC duties""
Description | An Active Directory data inbound queue is needed to allow organizations to integrate their existing users and groups into the NEXT platform. Two syncs will be created. The first sync is the initial sync that pulls all the data from an organization's AAD and queues it up to be saved on the Sawtooth network. The second sync will be the delta sync. The delta sync will be used to grab any differences from the last inbound sync (could either be a initial sync or a delta sync). Both syncs will be send data to a new RethinkDB table called ad_inbound_queue.
Business Need (the why): | To allow for organizations to easily adopt the NEXT platform for their RBAC management, the platform should include an option to import users from AAD. This inbound queue will store all the records from AAD before it gets saved on the Sawtooth blockchain.

After running docker-compose -f docker-multi-node.yaml up command,
four nodes will be created with each node hosting an instance of
Sawtooth Next Directory. Each node will have access to the blockchain
and will utilize a simulated version of PoET. The Next Directory UI
will be available at:
http://10.5.0.70:4200
http://10.5.0.71:4200
http://10.5.0.72:4200
http://10.5.0.73:4200

Note: Because user accounts authorization is currently being stored in the rethinkdb auth table and not being stored on the blockchain, when a user is created on a specific node, that user cannot sign in on a different node. All other data is shared among the four nodes.

This commit updates component templates and styles to match current
UI comps at a basic level.

A custom build of Semantic UI specific to our requirements replaces
generic styles. Therefore, much of the theming will come in the form of
updates to semantic.min.css in `src/themes`, which minimizes the need
to add styles within the app itself.

[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) is the approved typeface that will be used throughout the UI.

```pytest -m ""integration""``` for integration tests
Tests may be run and re-run interactively via shell.
```docker exec -it rbac-shell bash```
```pytest```
Or one-off via a clean docker image:
```bin/build -t```

Description | PR #166 adds a requirements.txt file with all of the python project dependencies for new contributors to install. `pipreqs` is already being used to initialize requirements.txt, and we already have a recursive script to format/lint all python scripts in this project, so we could use it to maintain requirements.txt as well. We'll also need to update README.md with instructions for running the script.
Business Need (the why): | Adding this to a recursive script like `bin/run_lint` would mean developers won't have to update requirements.txt, reducing the chance of missing dependencies.

Description | Python Dockerfiles currently install dependencies through pip manually with `RUN`, meaning developers must edit the Dockerfiles to add/remove dependencies. We should use `pipreqs` to generate a requirements.txt file in each container directory and use `RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt` after mounting the volumes in the container with `COPY`. Then developers only need to edit requirements.txt to add or remove python dependencies.  
Business Need (the why): | Contributors shouldn't have to touch the Dockerfiles unless they're actually changing the container itself.

Restart will show the error again. Not sure if those are stale logs or not (investigating). However, further down will read:

Description | In the event a designated approver is unavailable to approve identify access request, the system shall automatically re-direct the request to the next level up in that approver's organization.
Business Need (the why) | Technology allowing approvals to **automatically advance up** the organizational chart. This proactively moves requests from being stale in the system and not being addressed timely. Benefits the approver from having a backlog of requests.
Stakeholders | requester (manager, next level up), requestee
Details | Hierarchical definition is defined in #32 and will be administered in the approval engine, Epic #64 
User Scenarios | #32, #81 
Acceptance Criteria/Tests | _The list of tests or criteria to be used to validate the story has been completed. May still need UAT or SIT / integration testing with other stories._
Failure | _if any, fold in negative tests_
Definition of Done | After a pre-defined time has been reached for an approval, system shall automatically escalate approval request to the approvers next level up.

Epic Title | Multi-Party Approval
T-shirt size default is L(arge) | L
Description | Allow for system to automatically triage approvals needing more than one person's approval prior to provisioning permissions to applications/systems for a specific person as per request.

Multi-Party Approval
The first supported scenario for multi-party approval will be for re-authorizations.
  

That means, someone is a member of a role, but their membership in that role must be re-confirmed or it will expire.
Re-Authorization is required by at least one role owner, and by the manager of the member.
Thus, from a User Interface standpoint, the first requirement is to visually distinguish Access Requests from Re-Authorization Requests.
We will add a type on the proposal, so you can distinguish them.
For example, presently we have type = ADD_ROLE_MEMBER
We will add REAUTH_ROLE_MEMBER
A question for @ChrisSpanton, if someone REJECTS a REAUTH request, does the member lose access to that role immediately or upon expiration. I presume the former.
The other element of Multi-Party Re-Authorization scenario, is that the user's manager will see the request in addition to the role owners. For this, the User Interface doesn't need to do anything; that assignment happens on the back-end.
So really, that is all there is to our first supported Multi-Party approval scenario. @pgobin
  

To demo this feature, we can configure reauthorization to be required every 6 months, and that re-authorization requests occur 6 months prior to expiration. In reality, the values will be 6 months and perhaps 1 month respectively.

A question regarding this feature, I presume the user should need to enter a reason why they still need access to the role prior to the Re-Auth Request being visible to the approvers? CC @ChrisSpanton 

From a security standpoint, it could be valuable to allow any role owner to require any (or all) existing members to re-authorize. (A manual re-authorization trigger)
We could also configure a SECURITY_LEVEL configuration on a role, and have SECURITY_LEVEL = 1 (default) require 1 role owner, but SECURITY_LEVEL= 2 require 1 role owner + the manager. Thus would be equivalent to the Multi-Party requirements of Re-Auth, but requires no UI change at all.",closed,False,2018-09-13 17:30:45,2019-03-25 22:43:01

to localhost. There are a number of issues with the current setup.
When config.py is missing:

  *  The app builds and deploys without errors
  *  Errors in the server are hidden within its container
  *  Errors in the UI come out as CORS violations
  *  An unmanaged default config is easily lost in forking

This change designates config.py as config-localhost.py and
references it by default in main.py in a constant,
CONFIG_OVERRIDE_FILE. This allows the application to deploy
out-of-the-box.

Failure | designated proxy doesn't receive requests
Questions/Clarifications | 

- demo the UI for assigning a delegate. 
- Any pending requests already in the queue when delegation starts/stops shall be transferred to/from delegate. 
- Delegate request includes a message to delegate. 
- Delegate request shall trigger an email to recipient.  
- Approval/rejection of said request shall trigger an email notification to the requestor.
- during the duration of the delegation, any escalations that happen should still go to orginal owner manager (correct @chrisspanton )
- any place the role/pack owner name is referenced (ChatBot) during the delegation period, the delegate's name will be used.
- The granularity of the time interval shall be 'day' so transfers of proposals should begin/end at midnight (of which timezone?  Do we know the timezones of the two parties?)
- delegations shall be nestable or overlap-able -- multiple levels of delegation allowed.  We kinda need this if we are going to allow permanent delegations.
- originator of delegation can end it prematurely by resetting the end date -- but doesn't kick in until midnight
- The originator's people manager can modify the delegation (If I go on paternity leave and delegate to a peer, and then extend my leave by a week, I can call my boss and have them extend delegation)  This will trigger another accept email to the delegate.
- Anyone in the org is allowed to be delegated to and deal with approvals -- not limited to originators current org, his directs, etc...  
- if the delegate leaves the company all of their delegations shall revert back to originator (?  Does an email get triggered to someone here?)
- if the originator leaves the company during the time period should all ownership immediately revert to the manager?",closed,False,2018-09-06 17:52:45,2019-03-26 20:39:25

Additional User Story | all approval types in scope: expiration, re-authorization of access, new access
Acceptance Criteria/Tests | A NEXT admin can approve a bulk number of requests from the UI  There should be UI where role/pack owner can select which of the pending requests to process and then which result (so pick 3 of the 5 pending and approve, then pick the remaining 2 and reject).

Questions/Clarifications | 12/7 - Keith: Regarding the ""engine"" described above: I believe we have settled on (at least initially) multi-approvals being carried out on the UI as a series of individual approvals processed in a loop.

Functionality | Managers should have the ability to approve what their descendants (including direct reports) would be able to approve. 
Description |

Acceptance Criteria/Tests | See bulleted list below
Assumptions | 1) Requestor is authorized to approve for requestee. 2) Requestor and Requestee are valid entities 3) Requestor's next level up approver is a valid entity
Questions |

Acceptance Criteria:
- if manager approves/rejects, we write to the ledger ""Manager on behalf of Approver..."" so we can clearly see who took the action.
- The original approver should be able to see the manager's approve/reject with manager's name in the recent approvals page.
- the Manager should *also* see the their own name and on behalf of in their recent approval's page.
- if mgr's mgr takes the action we only record & display one level of 'on behalf of' -- (eg. don't show ""Jon approved on behalf of Sue on behalf of Kevin on behalf of Amy""  just show ""Jon approved on behalf of Amy""   (Or do we need to record this in ledger for audit so we know the state of the org structure at the time?)

@chrisspanton notes on Hierarchical Approval
This one is more difficult from a UI standpoint, because it's not clear where exactly you should see the Pending Requests for your direct reports.
If you can view ""yourself"" (profile page), then presumably you should be able to see your Direct Reports or even your Org Hierarchy on that page; and be able to click through on any of those people and see ""their page"".
On their page, recognizing that you are the manager or an ancestor, if you can see that user's view of their Pending Requests, you should be able to approve them on behalf of that user.
That user should be able to see recently approved Requests, and view that it was approved by another person on their behalf.
From a security standpoint, they ought to be able to Revoke that approval, and from an auditing standpoint it would be valuable in my opinion to allow them also to Confirm that approval. CC @chrisspanton

It appears task owners can only add or delete admins only if the task owner is the manager of the targeted user or they are the user themselves. Task owners should have full control of their task and they should have the ability to add/delete admins even if the owner is not the manager of the targeted user or the user being added/deleted. 

### Scenario
The owner of task `6d2956d5-fc09-454f-960e-0578c0ddeff7` would like to add a new task admin. The new admin has the user id `025a476a958b6fb1c762a8a5d674df9130257ab9129ff677e461493b252fbc1ec2`

Here is the CURL request for this operation:
`$ curl -X POST ""http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/6d2956d5-fc09-454f-960e-0578c0ddeff7/admins"" -H  ""accept: application/json"" -H  ""Authorization: task_owner's_bearer_token"" -H  ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d ""{  \""id\"": \""025a476a958b6fb1c762a8a5d674df9130257ab9129ff677e461493b252fbc1ec2\""}""
`

### Expected Result
A proposal is created with the type ADD_TASK_ADMINS and the response would contain the proposal ID.
```

I apologize in advance if the questions below seem stupid--I'm new to sawtooth in general and the NEXT project looked interesting.

I'm having issues setting up my machine to test this project. I followed the instructions on setting up the developer environment:

- I renamed `config.example.py` to `config.py`. Although this wasn't specifically specified under the developer section in the `README`, I figured I had to do this. I didn't change the default values since it's just for development purposes. 
- I ran the following commands:
```
bin/build -p
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up
```

I could successfully connect to `localhost:9090` and had access to the Rethink.DB admin page. However, my browser failed to establish a connection to the REST API on  `localhost:8080`.

Additionally, I had two errors in the console upon starting up:

1. Couldn't establish a database connection to ReThink.DB:
```
ledger-sync_1  | rethinkdb.errors.ReqlDriverError: Could not connect to rethink:28015. Error: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```
2. I also had the following error:
```
validator_1    | [2018-06-13 23:09:01.978 ERROR    cli] Cannot have a genesis_batch_file and an existing chain
```
Additionally, I tried following the instructions to setup the UI for a developer environment, but I couldn't get it working either. 

1. I changed directory to the `ui` folder--for me, it was located at `~/NEXT/sawtooth-next-directory/ui `
2. I ran `npm install`
3. Then I ran `npm install -g angular-cli` to install angular client.
4. Finally, I ran `npm install -g rxjs@5.0.1` because NPM said I was missing that dependency when I ran `npm list -g --depth=0`.

After finishing the steps above, when I tried to run `ng serve` from within the UI folder, I got a message saying `You have to be inside an angular-cli project in order to use the serve command.`

Lastly, assuming I fix all of the errors above, is there a way to simulate nodes (or is it provided already in the development environment included in the package?) in order to simulate having real people using the system? I'm just trying to get a feeling for how it would function on a production environment.

Thanks! I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
