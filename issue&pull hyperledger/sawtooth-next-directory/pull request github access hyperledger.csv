Justifying my change, we have several classes that adds logic to the object we are creating. For example, we want stuff to happen when it is created, or we need to perform some operations on it, or control how its displayed, etc. Dictionaries or tuples may not be the best to use in our case so I kept the classes, but set the minimum public methods to 0.

User Story | In support of #898 - The legacy implementation required user_id be equal to the user's public key. This will not remain true with respect to users imported from identity providers.
Description | Eliminates the linkage between user_id and public key. Adds the Sawtooth message to add a public key to the blockchain and assign it to a user.
Business Need (the why): | The first time a user logs into the application, a new Key is generated for that user. The public key of that key must be stored on-chain such that message signatures can be authenticated against registered keys and against business rules on authorized users and permissions required to execute actions on the system.

[Understand the Rasa Stack](https://rasa.com/docs/get_started_step1/)

> The Rasa Stack is a framework to build contextual AI assistants and chatbots. It consists of two open source libraries (Rasa NLU and Rasa Core).

[NLU](https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/)

> Rasa NLU is an open-source natural language processing tool for intent classification and entity extraction in chatbots. For example, taking a sentence like

[Architecture](https://rasa.com/docs/core/architecture/)

## In this PR:
- Add Docker service based on Rasa Core from `rasa/rasa_core:0.12.2`
- Add WebSocket route to server for handling chatbot requests
- Add NLU language processor
- Add script to train Core and NLU
- Add initial training data

## Gist:
- `bin/train` trains Core and NLU from documents in `/chatbot`
- Core server waits for incoming requests on port 5005
- JS client sends message payload to `/api/chatbot` over `ws://` as serialized JSON
- REST server POSTs to Core server, providing it conversational context via user ID
- Core server replies with chatbot response `->` REST server responds `->` Client displays view

## Notes:
- Client changes not included

## Todo:
- Conversations exist in memory. Create adapter for Rethink.
- REST auth middleware doesn't yet use token from socket handshake

This makes all docker files use a base set of common

Renamed tmobile-rbac to hyperledger-rbac as the working
directory name. Run bin/clean to remove pycache directories
that may otherwise cause an error.

bin/clean will also suggest pruning all existing docker
images. That is optional but recommended.

bin/start, bin/start -d and docker-compose up are equivalent.
still use the -b flag as --build or -p flag for persistent
data on bin/start.

Terming into the containers shows the old tmobile working path.

After running docker-compose -f docker-multi-node.yaml up command,
four nodes will be created with each node hosting an instance of
Sawtooth Next Directory. Each node will have access to the blockchain
and will utilize a simulated version of PoET. The Next Directory UI
will be available at:
http://10.5.0.70:4200
http://10.5.0.71:4200
http://10.5.0.72:4200
http://10.5.0.73:4200

Note: Because user accounts authorization is currently being stored in the rethinkdb auth table and not being stored on the blockchain, when a user is created on a specific node, that user cannot sign in on a different node. All other data is shared among the four nodes.

This commit updates component templates and styles to match current
UI comps at a basic level.

A custom build of Semantic UI specific to our requirements replaces
generic styles. Therefore, much of the theming will come in the form of
updates to semantic.min.css in `src/themes`, which minimizes the need
to add styles within the app itself.

[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) is the approved typeface that will be used throughout the UI.

This increases test coverage of the addresser, and breaks the tests out into pieces for maintainability and self-documentation.

Run using ```pytest```

It makes one small code change to validate the entire address string via regular expression instead of just checking the prefix of the string.

It does not attempt comprehensive test coverage of the addresser, but enough to facilitate future refactoring of the addressing code and addressing scheme.

The current sources provide a config.sample.py that is to be
copied and renamed to config.py before the application can deploy
to localhost. There are a number of issues with the current setup.
When config.py is missing:

  *  The app builds and deploys without errors
  *  Errors in the server are hidden within its container
  *  Errors in the UI come out as CORS violations
  *  An unmanaged default config is easily lost in forking

This change designates config.py as config-localhost.py and
references it by default in main.py in a constant,
CONFIG_OVERRIDE_FILE. This allows the application to deploy
out-of-the-box.
