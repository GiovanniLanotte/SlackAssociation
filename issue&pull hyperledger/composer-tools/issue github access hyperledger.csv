The error results in the improper creation of DevServer_connection.json, and subsequently causes the `composer card import` for the PeerAdmin@hlfv1 network card to fail. As a result a user can't setup a hlfv11 business network with the new Composer Tools Fabric-Dev-Servers v1.2 download. 

It took some time to track this down, because the error is in a JSON layout inside the createPeerAdmin.sh bash file. It appears there was an omission in v1.2 as Composer Tools v1.1 Fabric-Dev-Servers obviously had the correct code.

If composer node is throwing an error like **MVCC_Read_conflict** then it can be seen only on **debug console** in node-red but cannot be captured. If it can be captured then this may be use to re-submit the transaction. 

There may be one solution to this problem. If `node.error(msg)` in composer node-red code can be change to `node.error(""Error"",msg)` Then already available `catch` node in node-red may be used to capture the error and may be transaction can be re-submitted using it.

I have found this tutorial to connect node-red with composer. 
https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/unstable//tutorials/nodered-tutorial

When I try to create a new participant with some JSON Data, then an error message comes: Error: creating resource error Card not found: admin@tutorial-network Wrong Business Network Card specified.

My guess is  that node-red and hyperledger composer has to be on the same vm, so the network card can be found. It this correct?

How can node-red connect to composer without the REST API?

Is there any connection.json file available to specify my connection data to my hyperledger composer for the nodes in node-red?

something like this in the example of the fabric-dev-servers tools:

`{
    ""type"": ""hlfv1"",
    ""orderers"": [
       { ""url"" : ""grpc://localhost:7050"" }
    ],
    ""ca"": { ""url"": ""http://localhost:7054"", 
            ""name"": ""ca.org1.example.com""
    },
    ""peers"": [
        {
            ""requestURL"": ""grpc://localhost:7051"",
            ""eventURL"": ""grpc://localhost:7053""
        }
    ],
    ""keyValStore"": ""${HOME}/.composer-credentials"",
    ""channel"": ""composerchannel"",
    ""mspID"": ""Org1MSP"",
    ""timeout"": ""300""
}`


or is the only working alternativeto connect node-red remotly with hyperledger over the REST-API?

The work-around for me was to install the plugin from the command inside the `.node-red` user settings. 

Note beyond, I am able to install other plugins via ""Manage Palette"" without problems. So, I don't think it is a general issue with my setup or the way I am using node-red.

Here is how to reproduce the issue:

* Install hyperledger as described in the [development guide](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/development-tools.html) - I am using Ubuntu LTS 16.04.3 (64-bit) and Node.js 8.9.1
* Allow unprivileged users for installing global npm packages  (this one is missing in the development guide, btw!) - I used [npm-g_nosudo](https://github.com/glenpike/npm-g_nosudo) for the setup
* Install node-red - Execute `npm install -g node-red` as  unprivileged user (no need for `--unsafe-perm` at this point)
* Start node-red - Execute `node-red` on the command line with the user account used to run hyperledger composer and fabric
* Try to install the plugin using ""Manage Palette""
