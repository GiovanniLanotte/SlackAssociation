You can try to replace the script 'createPeerAdminCard.sh' under folder 'hlfv11' as below and retry.

As I wrote above there is only one key/value missing from the Composer Tools for Fabric 1.2 createPeerAdmin.sh. To mitigate the problem add the eventURL key/value as described above to the `fabric-dev-servers/hlfv11/createPeerAdminCard.sh`. This is an effective work around. ,2018-09-03 05:37:01,2018-09-03 05:38:10

I tried to share only docker.sock in it with `:z` but this command is still failing with permission denied by SELinux:
```
composer network start --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --archiveFiletutorial-network@0.0.1.bna --file networkadmin.card
```

When I searched more I found more info https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/386767/selinux-and-docker-allow-access-to-x-unix-socket-in-tmp-x11-unix. It's related to sharing X socket but I think that it is somehow related.

When I execute `ausearch -c 'peer' --raw` there is:
```

Currently the part of my `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:
```
  peer0.org1.example.com:
    ...
    volumes:
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/host/var/run/docker.sock:z
        - ./:/etc/hyperledger/configtx:z
        - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/msp:/etc/hyperledger/peer/msp:z
        - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users:/etc/hyperledger/msp/users:z
    security_opt:
      - label:type:container_runtime_t
    ...
```

Changes that I've made:

 1. Added `:z` at the end of every volume definition for every service.
 2. Instead of mounting the whole `/var/run` from the host to mount only `docker.sock` socket file
 3. Added `security_opt` section to `peer0.org1.example.com` to set the same label as currently defined by default SELinux policy on Fedora.

This is a _really_ big change and a big change like this should really be covered by an issue or mailing list post and subsequent discussion before a PR is submitted. 

We use Markdown everywhere, not just in this repository. If we were to make this change, we should be consistent and change everywhere that we use Markdown.

We use Markdown in the following places:
- To describe our repositories via README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md files, etc.
- In the GitHub wikis on the main repository.
- Most importantly though, Markdown is used for all of our public website documentation, which is then built via Jekyll.

I had never heard of Asciidoc before you submitted this PR. The includes functionality doesn't seem that useful to warrant such a big change, especially when GitHub doesn't render it without a Chrome specific extension? We seem to be managing OK without it so far.

In the following, I´ll use adoc for Asciidoc and md for Markdown.

The chrome plugin is NOT required. If you don´t use the plugin, .adoc or .md will behave the same in Github. In general adoc is just superior to md but covers the same minimum set of features. As a matter of fact, renaming a md to adoc does most of the work of switching to adoc.

If you visit https://github.com/chevdor/composer-tools/tree/doc you will see that adoc renders in a similar way than md in a regular browser without any plugin/extension.

If you use adoc however you gain lots of goodies (includes, tocs, ability to include sample code from actual code...). The include feature I mentioned is just one of them and I ensure that you are mistaken if you think this is a small benefit. 

I attach a 'print' of the README.adoc to give you an idea. There are also tons of ways to render adoc to PDF, Ebooks, etc....

[Hyperledger Composer.pdf](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/files/1393696/Hyperledger.Composer.pdf)

As you mentioned, today, many of the doc file are described in .md files all over the place (readme, contributing, etc...) but since there is no link between them, it is hard for users to find them all and it is obviously hard to maintain. I am seeing lots of discrepancy in the HL and HL-composer doc because doc and code don´t evolve together. The include feature for instance, allows bringing into the doc an actual snippet of code from the original source file. I am not talking about copy/pasting some code snippet into the doc, I am talking about (include...) letting the doc know where to go find the very latest code snippet an include it into the doc. That would benefit the both users and maintainers a lot!

Feel free to reject such a PR but do your due diligence before that.

> I had never heard of Asciidoc before...

It sounds like time to check it out :)

> doesn't seem that useful

Really time to check it out. It would be sad to stop with a ""does not seem to...""

> a big change

This is not a big change. But yes, I admit this is a change.

> Needing a chrome plugin to render it on GitHub seems to outweigh benefits

The extension is NOT needed t render on Github. What I wrote is that the extension helps rendering the **include**s. Without the extension, you simply get some similar to what md offers.",2017-10-18 07:29:44,2017-10-18 07:29:44
