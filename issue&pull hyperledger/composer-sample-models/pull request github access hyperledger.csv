The issue #1500 deals with the fact that a query in vehicle lifecycle network is not running.

Solution
The query Native is not supported now. The feature of Named Query has been implemented instead. After code review, a change is suggested to rename a transaction ScrapAllVehiclesByColour to ScarpAllVehiclesByColourTxn. For this a change is made in model file vda.cto of vehicle network.

Solution
The query Native is not supported now. The feature of Named Query has been implemented instead. The same is added here in. A suggestion is made after code review to rename a transaction ScrapAllVehiclesByColour to ScrapAllVehiclesByColourTxn to make code easily readable. For that purpose a change is made in model file (*.cto file) and added.
