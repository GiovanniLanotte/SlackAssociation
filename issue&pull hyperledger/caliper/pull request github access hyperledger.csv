Suggested fix for #382

Following the generation of some Caliper reports, I noticed that the report structure could be enhanced. I have changed the template and associated report code to follow the config file more closely and make the report more readable by:
- Group test rounds under each test label, with each round starting at zero for each label.
- Link to test labels instead of test rounds from the metadata side navigation (this is a more meaningful link)
- Enable the provision of a description for each test label that is taken from the config file.

I have attached a file that is generated by the code.

The Docker build script assumes that the Caliper repo is cloned into a `caliper` folder. But actually, the last `../caliper/` directory change is unnecessary. 

## Steps to Reproduce
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper.git caliper-fork
# remove the previous image to trigger a rebuild
docker rmi simple-tp-python
npm i
npm run sawtooth-deps
npm run bench -- -c benchmark/simple/config-sawtooth.yaml -n network/sawtooth/simplenetwork/sawtooth.json
```

## Design of the fix
The path reference is simplified in the build script, thus completely avoiding the Caliper directory name.

## Validation of the fix
Repeat the above steps to reproduce.

## Issue/User story
Changes related to the adapter:
* Updated the sample benchmarks to also support the new adapter API
* Added settings for the new adapter in the default Caliper configuration file
* Added sample network configurations for the new adapter (from v1.0 to v1.2, including mutual TLS networks from v1.1). Most of the additions originate from these example configurations, which are easy to check/test
* Added lightweight Caliper-level dependecies (for general use, not Fabric-specific packages), like `tmp` and `version-compare`
* Changed some `require` calls to YAML parsing for reading network configuration files in `bench-flow.js`
* Integrated the new adapter into `blockchain.js`
* Added general utility functions for checking/asserting property and version-related information

## Directly related issues (and many more regarding the other adapter)
#37 #115 #139 #185 #227 #292
## Validation of the fix
For each sample benchmark, pick a configuration file (like the linear rate config), and run it with every network version/topology/`fabric-ccp*` configuration combination.

Addresses #259 

The PR includes:
1. Added example networks for Fabric 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
1. Added separate examples for CouchDB and GoLevelDB backends
1. Added setup scripts for each version
1. Enhanced the Readme files for each network
1. Removed the `Xorg3peer` networks, since they're too resource consuming. For testing purposes the max 2 peer networks are enough
1. Each sample network (Composer or Fabric) is deployed with every available chaincodes (golang and node configs separately). See the network Readme files
1. Changed the default network configs to lightweight defaults (2 orgs, 1 peer with GoLevelDB)

Additional necessary fixes:
1. Parse the config directly in the Fabric adapter, since SDK@1.2 fails to add the file to the Client config
1. Check the type of the peers returned when querying installed chaincodes, since SDK@1.2 returns ChannelPeer instances instead of Peer instances that are required for the query

## Validation of the fix
Test the sample benchmarks with the compatible sample networks. E.g., in the Caliper root folder:
```
npm install
npm run fabric-v1.1-deps
node benchmark/simple/main.js -c config-linear-rate.yaml -n network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-node-tls.json
node benchmark/smallbank/main.js -c config.yaml -n network/fabric-v1.1/2org1peergoleveldb/fabric-node-tls.json
# etc.

## Issue/User story
PR for spitting caliper process into transaction sender and event listener.

Short Description
Current version of the caliper relies on a single threaded process to send the transactions as well as to listen for the transaction confirmation event. This can cause an issue for clients with higher send rates since node.js is itself a single threaded. The callback of the eventhub may get queued in the event loop and hence may result in incorrect confirmation time or drop in events

## Design of the fix
To tackle this issue, caliper can be split into 2 sub processes namely,

sender who is just responsible for generating the transaction load
listener which connects to the event peer, listens for the block event, note the timestamp and then publish it to Apache Kafka MQ.
A persistence layer is required so that after the sender has finished generating the load, it can then consume blocks and associated confirmation time from the Queue and compute time_final property for every transaction.

This PR consolidates network-related configuration files:
1. Removed the blockchain section and command section which were in the config.json files.
2. Added Caliper section which included blockchain subsection and command subsection into the network configuration files.
3. As the network related configurations   were removed from those configuration files,  there were many reduplicated configuration files. So removed the configuration files ended with -tls.json.

## Issue/User story
This PR consolidates network-related configuration files and samples targeting Fabric and Composer. The changes include:

1. Removed the `simplenetwork` example network, since it's basically the `2org2peer` network. Changed the configuration files where needed.
1. Renamed the Fabric network directories, so they don't contain dashes. Relates to Issue #198 
1. Added TLS and no-TLS versions for every Fabric-based config (see the design of the fix). This should solve many SSL-related errors (like the bogus request from client error in the orderer) that resulted from incompatible settings on client and network side.
1. Changed some TPS rates in the configs to lower values.
1. Fixed the cert paths in the Composer dev network config.

N.B.: Once Issue #218 is resolved, many of the configs can be deleted, but until that, this explicit separation of TLS and no-TLS configs is the less error-prone way to specify the configs. (The number of current configs is the main motivation behind Issue #218 ).

## Existing issues
* #198 

## Design of the fix
For every sample benchmark and for every configuration (`config*.json`) that target Fabric there are now two versions: without and with TLS (e.g., `config.json` and `config-tls.json`). The different versions start a different kind of network: without and with TLS, respectively (e.g., `fabric.json` and `fabric-tls.json`).

## Validation of the fix
Run every sample benchmark with every Fabric-based configuration (`config*.json`).

## Short Description
Current version of the caliper relies on a single threaded process to send the transactions as well as listen for the transaction confirmation event. This can cause an issue for clients with higher send rates since node.js is itself a single threaded. The callback of the eventhub may get queued in the event loop and hence may result in incorrect confirmation time.

To tackle this issue, caliper can be split into 2 sub processes namely,
* sender who is just responsible for generating the transaction load
* listener which connects to the event peer, listens for the block event, note the timestamp and then publish it to Apache Kafka MQ. 

A persistence layer is required so that after the sender has finished generating the load, it can then consume blocks and associated confirmation time from the Queue and compute `time_final` property for every transaction.",[],34,2018-07-12 06:44:40,2018-11-27 15:51:44,2018-11-27 15:51:44,False,,,dirty,False,closed

I actualized used containers in **docker-compose.yml**, simple benchmark code (we slightly changed our API) and node configs.

### PLEASE PAY ATTENTION: 

I removed grpc@1.10.1 from the main **package.json** because:
1. It sufficiently increases dependencies installing time by `npm install`. grpc _of this version_ compiles from sources, despite I have a very widespread system (Ubuntu 18.04, x86_64).
2. This grpc package conflicts with the version from **iroha-lib** package.

So I removed both dependencies and specify in README.md additional dependency iroha-lib@0.1.7 in Iroha's section and grpc@1.10.1 in Fabric's section. It's not the best solution, but I couldn't think of a better one

This PR provides the required folders and scripts to enable Travis CI against the Caliper project.

**Please note that I cannot perform the Travis enablement and enforcement on the project as I do not have the required privileges; it will have to be completed by a Caliper admin if/when merged**

The PR delivers the following:
- provides Travis configuration files to build and run the specified tests
- specified tests include:
-- lint checking
-- unit test checking (rate controllers) with code coverage
-- e2e code run

The lint checker is based from the main lint checking specification, which currently has some files excluded (these file exclusions are being worked on)

The unit tests are mocha based and driven using nyc to provide code coverage reports. An example test is provided for the fixed rate controller. All other files are currently excluded and I would suggest issues being raised to fill these holes.

The e2e code run represents the *actual* running of all existing Caliper benchmarks. This is currently only for locally hosted (not zookeeper) benchmarks, but goes a long way to ensure that nothing is broken within the framework. Due to the nature of running benchmarks on a CI machine, the TPS listed in some of the benchmarks has been reduced, since timeouts will cause a build failure.

This PR is the first in a series of PRs aimed at resolving #22 

This PR contains changes that:
- add a linting rules file (common rule file selected)
- add eslint to devDependancies
- add package script to run lint checker (via `npm run lint`)
- update all Composer code to follow linting rules
- update rate controllers to follow linting rules
- add an eslint-ignore file to ignore lint checking on all other files
- renamed `src/comm/sleep` to be a common utility file `src/comm/util` and refactored all code to use the sleep method in the common code

The reason for the expansion of the common util to include 'sleep' and 'log' is the `no-console' linting rule, which is most elegantly eliminated using a single point of use and a single `eslint-diable` call. It is probable that this common utility will expand as more common code is identified and eliminated.

Since it is not straightforward how to incorporate (if at all) the extra time needed to verify a Tx status through a query (and when to do that), I think the best option, for now, is to leave this to the callback module. It still has access to the configured context (except the event hubs) in the `end` callback, so if needed, verification can happen there.",[],1,2018-04-12 00:00:10,2018-04-12 02:30:51,2018-04-12 02:30:51,True,2018-04-12 02:30:51,haojun,unknown,,closed

The controller mechanism acts to maintain a fixed level of backlog transactions, using a discrete time PID control mechanism to modify the driven transaction rate to achieve a fixed backlog. A user must prescribe control gains, as well as a starting TPS to seed the controller. 

Contribution includes:
- New rate controller with header description
- Update of fixed-rate controller to add header description
- Docs modification to indicate availability of controller
