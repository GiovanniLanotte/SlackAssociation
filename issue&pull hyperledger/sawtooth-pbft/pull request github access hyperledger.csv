the nodes will be able to build a seal using the messages.

network with an existing chain using the adhoc docker compose files.
Also adds this test to CI.

arbitrarily crash another node's PBFT engine.

When parsing messages from peers, nodes use the type indicated in the
header of the PeerMessage; however, this type field can be set
arbitrarily and could be set to a different value than the contained
PBFT message's type. Some of the accessors for ParsedMessages panic if
called on the wrong type of ParsedMessage (e.g. calling get_seal on a
ParsedMessage containing a NewView), so there must be a mechanism to
guard against a bad message triggering a panic.

This is fixed by simply checking and ensuring that the ParsedMessage's
type matches the type of the PeerMessage. An alternative would be to
remove the panics in the accessors, but those are useful for ensuring
that no programmer error occurs; we should be able to guarantee proper
parsing of messages, and once those messages are parsed they should only
be handled as the appropriate type.

signers of messages and votes are verified.

Previously, when messages were received, the PbftMessage's signer_id was
compared with the ID of the node that sent the message; however, the
node that sent the message may not be the node that signed it, so this
is the wrong thing to compare it to; instead, it should be comparing the
PbftMessage's signer_id with the PeerMessageHeader's signer_id (this is
the ID that is used by the validator to verify the proper signing of the
consensus message).

Furthermore, when votes are verified for the consensus seal and view
changes, the IDs used to check membership and uniqueness are the IDs in
the PbftMessages themselves, and they were previously not compared with
the IDs that are used to actually sign the messages (again, indicated by
the signer_id of the ConsensusPeerMessageHeader). They should be
compared with the actual signing ID to be sure they match.

These changes break existing unit tests, since signing of messages in
these tests was just done with a random public public key that did not
match IDs in the or the IDs of the actual messages. Since these unit
tests are being replaced, they are not fixed but instead removed.

seal, package it up in a `SealResponse` message, and send the message

`view_change_timeout`; this is a departure from the PBFT definition and
the view change RFC
(https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/29/files).

The new timeout is roughly equivalent to the `idle_timeout`, but with
the key difference that it is stopped when a node has both a BlockNew
and a corresponding PrePrepare for the next block rather than just a
BlockNew.

This timeout will guarantee liveness in the presence of a faulty primary
by ensuring that the primary cannot indefinitely halt the network by
failing to produce a block or a PrePrepare. However, we do not need to
use a full commit timeout to ensure that a block is actually committed
on time, because whether or not a block is committed does not depend on
the primary. Once the primary has produced a block and a PrePrepare, the
network as a whole is responsible for validating the block and sending
the required messages to actually commit it; a faulty primary cannot
prevent this on its own. This means that if there is a failure to commit
a block, then there are more than f faulty nodes, and therefore a view
change will not be able to provide liveness.

This change provides the same liveness guarantees as before, but
prevents the network from unnecessarily starting a view change when it
will not help the network continue progress.

is no longer needed with the consensus seal and the guarantees that are
provided by the state management of the blockchain. Because the
blockchain stores all state history and each block is verified by a
consensus seal that consists of PBFT messages that prove the block
commit, we are never truly garbage collecting; the blockchain will
always have these messages and state changes. This makes checkpointing
unnecessary.

The following is a summary of the changes that are made by this shift:
- When a seal is verified, it's stored in the log for potential use in a
view change message
- If a view change is required, the seal for the last committed block is
included in the view change message as the equivalent to the proof of
the last stable checkpoint.
- Consensus seals are garbage collected after each block is committed.
Once a block commits we only keep the last valid consensus seal, since
that's all we need to provide for a view change message.
- Garbage collection now happens once the number of messages in the log
is greater than or equal to the value specified in the `max_log_size`
configuration variable.

This allows us the flexibility of having a ""heavy"" container with build dependencies (`docker-compose.yml`), and a ""light"" container with just runtime dependencies (`docker-compose-installed.yml`), all defined in the same Dockerfile. The advantage to having a single Dockerfile comes from preventing code drift between two separate files.
