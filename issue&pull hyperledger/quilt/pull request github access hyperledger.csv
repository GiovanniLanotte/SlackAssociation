Currently this is used when reading in a UInt8 value which is the packet type for an InterledgerPacket. This allows the packet codec to set the correct internal codecs for the rest of the read operation.

This only worked for UIn8 as it depended on the serializer calling `decode`.

The new behaviour causes the event to be fired for all codecs even if the serializer calls `setChars(String)` or `setBytes(byte[])` for more complex codecs such as the UInt64 or Utf8String etc.

The InterledgerPacket is also updated to use the new event.

This PR simplifies the AddressParser by restoring all null-input invariant checks back into the InterledgerAddress. By not allowing `null` into the AddressParser by design, it no longer must account for multi-error conditions related to `null` values, and can focus on its core purpose, which is validity checks on non-null input.

A more detailed rationale:
1. AddressParser should not be doing any null-check enforcement, because InterledgerAddress itself should enforce the non-use of `null` as a developer error. In other words, there is a distinction between `null` making its way into an `InterledgerAddress` and some non-null String input that simply doesn't rise to the bar enforced by IL-RFC-15.

2. Once the parser becomes responsible for address content and formation checking only, it is somewhat simplified. The 4 `InterledgerAddress#require` methods no longer need to delegate to `AddressParser` because the logic is not complicated enough to justify the delegation.

3. Once moved back into InterledgerAddress, these implementations do not share any code between themselves (i.e., the two `requireAddressPrefix` methods are slightly duplicative, and the two `requireNotAddressPrefix` methods are also slightly duplicative). In each case, this is for performance reasons -- for example, we might be tempted to have `requireAddressPrefix(address)` delegate to `requireAddressPrefix(address, message)` with a default `message`. However, the happy-path usage of this call-chain would compute a new String for the error message, which would be different for every check of every ILP address in a system, and 99% of the time this String allocation would be unnecessary. In other words, we only want to assemble an error-string (with an ILP address inside) _if_ the method will actually throw an Exception. Thus, we optimize for the happy-path and duplicate the `if` check.
