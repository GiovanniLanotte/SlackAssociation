The container dies with this error:

The cause with protobuf. New generated code from a newer version of protoc, the protobuf compiler, is being used with old protobuf runtime. The runtime can be newer or the same (is backwards compatible), but the protobuf runtime cannot be older.

I may be going out on a limb here, but I believe the protobuf library came from `repo.sawtooth.me`, used for internal Sawtooth testing and development, in file `rest_api/Dockerfile`. Again, this is just an unproven theory of mine.",2019-04-03 21:22:22,2019-04-03 21:22:22

Hi,
The problem happened as the protobuf runtime lib version supplied/installed by Dockerfile is older than protoc. So to solve the problem, just make sure that the containers update the runtime lib by modifying Dockerfile in their respective folder.
For Dockerfile in processor folder, make sure to also install ""python3-pip"" (add to the end of line 22). Then for Dockerfile in all three folders (processor, rest_api, simple_supply_subscriber), add ""RUN pip3 install -U protobuf"" to update the installed protobuf runtime lib. 

Hope that helps.",2018-10-11 04:54:28,2018-10-11 04:54:28
