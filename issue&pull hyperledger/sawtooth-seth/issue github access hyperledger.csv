sawtooth-seth,aludvik,https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/20,https://api.github.com/repos/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/issues/20,Create initial MAINTAINERS list,"This list is intended to recognize current contributors to the
sawtooth-seth repository who have:

- Been actively involved for a substantial amount of time
- Made significant contributions that have been critical to the success
  of the project
- Frequently reviewed pull requests and left thoughtful and
  constructive feedback

To come up with this list objectively, I had to use some git-fu as the repo
also contains a lot of commits from sawtooth-core, so GitHub insights was not
sufficient.

I started by counting all commits in the repository that touched either
`families/burrow_evm` or `families/seth` in core before the commit where the
component was moved out of core, which was
f6fb1bd80e12f668d9d9e70e6150b3db7ad6f7f6

To accomplish this, I did:

    git log -- families/burrow_evm families/seth | grep Author | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

The cutoff commit was on `Thu Nov 16 15:14:54 2017 -0600`.

After this point, commits to the repo only contained commits to sawtooth-seth
(no sawtooth-core) so I was able to use GitHub insights from that date to the
present. That list can be found here:

https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/graphs/contributors?from=2017-11-17&to=2018-03-29&type=c

I merged the commit counts from these two lists and took all the names that had
more than 10 commits.

The list has been sorted by first name.

This has led to a disorganized and confusing directory structure. In order to give Seth a good user story and development workflow, this PR reorganizes the repo and simplifies the build process for development.

In order to build and run Seth, just run`docker-compose up --build`. This will build images and start up containers for all Seth components:
- Seth CLI
- Seth TP
- Block info TP
- Settings TP
- Sawtooth REST API
- Sawtooth Validator
- Seth JSON RPC

In order to accomplish this, the following steps were taken:
- Create new Dockerfiles for each Seth component
    - These Dockerfiles will import Sawtooth 1.0 dependencies instead of cloning in
      the whole repo
- Update docker-compose.yaml to build an image for each component and
  run the containers
- Update imports in .go files and Cargo.toml to correct dependencies
