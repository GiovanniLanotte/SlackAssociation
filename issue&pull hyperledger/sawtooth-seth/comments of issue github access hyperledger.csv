To be clear, this change doesn't allow for contract state updates when transaction execution fails. It simply records the transaction execution failure in the transaction receipt format that is appropriate for the transaction family.

Prior to these changes there was no way for a client which submitted its transactions via Seth's RPC interface to determine whether the transaction was executed, and what the result of that execution was.

Via the Ethereum RPC interface, the usual transaction flow looks like this:

1. Client submits a message call transaction to a contract address via either the `eth_sendTransaction` or the `eth_sendRawTransaction` RPC call
2. Server responds with RPC response containing transaction hash in the `result` field
3. Client uses the transaction hash returned by the server to poll for the result of the transaction via `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.
4. Until the transaction is mined into a block, the server always returns `null` in response to the client's `eth_getTransactionReceipt` request.
5. When the transaction is mined into a block, regardless of whether the transaction succeeded or failed,  the server responds to `eth_getTransactionReceipt` with a valid transaction receipt.
6. The client inspects the `status` field in `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to determine whether their transaction succeeded or failed.

If no receipt is produced when a message call to a contract address fails due to a runtime error (e.g. due to the `REVERT` opcode), then the client can't tell the difference between transaction failure, and the transaction never starting.",2018-10-24 01:45:34,2018-10-24 01:46:32

Am I correct in understanding there are three types of validity with Ethereum transactions? 
1. Totally valid - The transaction ""object"" was valid and the execution was a success
2. Valid but failed -  The transaction ""object"" was valid but the execution failed
3. Invalid - The transaction ""object"" was invalid because of something like a bad signature, bad payload, incorrect nonce.
