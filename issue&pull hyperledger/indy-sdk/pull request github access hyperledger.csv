This PR is W.I.P. - I have a few questions if someone can please help me:

1.  Is PR for pluggable wallets something you are interested in?  I have added support for create, open, close - delete and export/import are still outstanding, I can complete and submit if there is interest.

2.  Regarding long-running transactions - e.g. Faber sends Alice a PR, but won't get a response until Alice responds (potentially hours or even days) - I've assumed that the objects (Connection, Proof, etc.) can be serialized, stored (in the wallet?) and then retrieved and deserialized later, is this a correct assumption?  See updated Alice/Faber demo (e.g. https://github.com/ianco/indy-sdk/blob/vcx_prototype/vcx/wrappers/python3/demo/faber.py#L216).  Is this a correct assumption?  And if so is VCX going to support the save/restore of the serialized objects or does the application need to deal with that?

3.  I notice that VCX opens the wallet - this means the application can't have a previously opened wallet, because indy-sdk will throw a WalletAlreadyOpened error.  Is VCX going to deal with (proxy) all indy-sdk operations or should the VCX API take an (optional) wallet handle as a parameter?

4.  I notice VCX uses global variables to store current settings (https://github.com/ianco/indy-sdk/blob/vcx_prototype/vcx/libvcx/src/settings.rs#L238)?  Have you considered adding a context or context handle to VCX API to allow VCX to support multi-tenancy?  Currently it looks like it can only support a single wallet?

5.  In the Python demo, the Proof Response (Alice) always seg faults at the end, after sending the proof to Faber, is this something you also experience?

As discussed in the HIPE [0025-indy-docs-framework](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0025-indy-docs-framework/README.md) we would like to have a centralized site for our documentation. The changes I have made are outlined in that HIPE. 

Here, you will see a couple of things: 
- I've changed the `doc/` directory to the `docs/` directory to match the rest of the indy repositories. This change was helpful for the automated docs builder. 
- Fixed links to the old `doc/` directory within the READMEs 
- Organized the `docs/` directory into subdirectories based on topic
- Deleted the `/doc/dkms/DKMS Design and Architecture V3.md` because it was a stub file that only referenced the newer [doc here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/677a0439487a1b7ce64c2e62671ed3e0079cc11f/doc/design/005-dkms/DKMS%20Design%20and%20Architecture%20V3.md)
- Most of the files changed are just name changes because of the directory rename. 

The significant files added are
- `conf.py` - this must be added to the root directory to include `docs/` folders from subproject like vcx.
- `docs/README.md`

Supersedes PR #1175 (refactor in-mem storage) - this PR includes:

Plug-in wallet storage for Postgres
Updates to CLI to register dynamic storage for wallets

And from the in-mem PR (1175):

Added a new shared library containing inmem wallet storage plug-in (to demonstrate and test dynamic storage loading).

Added python wrapper functions to load wallet storage from shared library.

Updated unit tests to optionally use dynamic storage rather than default via environment parameters:

STG_CONFIG - json configuration string to pass to the wallet on creation and open
STG_CREDS - json credentials string to pass to the wallet on creation and open
STG_TYPE - storage type to create
STG_LIB - c-callable library to load (contains a plug-in storage)
(if specified will dynamically load and register a wallet storage)
STG_FN_PREFIX - prefix for all plug-in functions (allows standard function naming)

For example to run tests against the inmem wallet:

STG_TYPE=inmem_custom STG_LIB=../samples/storage/storage-inmem/target/debug/libindystrginmem.dylib STG_FN_PREFIX=inmemwallet_fn_ cargo test issuer_create_and_store_credential_def_works

Most of the tests failed, even after correcting compilation errors.  This PR fixes most of the issues.   I wanted to get this into the repo now so that others are no longer blocked with broken tests.

**Major accomplishments**:

1. Signatures for indy sdk API native methods and .NET wrappers updated
2. The unit tests compile and no crashes

wrote that the encoding is application specific and the ZKPs don't care as long as the result of the encoding is a string representing a number. @swcurran 's counter argument was that it helps interoperabilty if common values are encoded in a common way.

I modelled this along the lines of https://von-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/von_agent/codec.html?highlight=codec but not 100%. Not sure about their float encoding as I think that if
e1 = encode(float1) and e2 = encode(float2) and float1 > float2 then
Number(e1) > Number(e2) etc

Of course all wrappers should use the same encoding or use a Rust implementation which is not 100% correct to put into libindy...

It supports the full libindy api with the exception of `indy_register_wallet_type`. It’s been published to npm and the installation process works. The usage, and api is fully documented along with notes on contributing. (see it [here](https://github.com/Picolab/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/nodejs/README.md)) It's been shown to work on linux and osx.

I updated the jenkins ci/cd files. To publish the package we will need an npm user account. Also the build servers will need the LTS version of nodejs. [The n bash script](https://github.com/tj/n) is the easiest way to install node and switch between versions.

What’s left:
- [x] Finish testing the api (about 30% done)
- [ ] Windows testing (I don’t anticipate too much trouble since it's using [nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan))

  - Updated `indy_crypto_sign` with additional method parameters
  - Changed `indy_crypto_box` to `indy_crypto_auth_crypt`
  - Changed `indy_crypto_box_open` to `indy_crypto_auth_decrypt`
  - Changed `indy_crypto_box_seal_open` to `indy_crypto_anon_decrypt`
  - Changed `indy_crypto_box_seal` to `indy_crypto_anon_crypt`
- SignusApi - naming changed to DidApi as methods are now part of `did.rs`
  - Added wrapper for `indy_get_my_did_with_meta`
  - Added wrapper for `indy_list_my_dids_with_meta`
  - Added wrapper fr `indy_abbreviate_verkey`
- ErrorCodes - updated missing message code

- WalletApi
  - Added wrapper for `indy_list_wallets`

Some of the unit tests were updated to reflect the changes. Unit tests that are using old schemas are failing, they need to updated. I may have some capacity to update this in the coming week. I tested the method with a sample application and they worked as expected.

Best,
