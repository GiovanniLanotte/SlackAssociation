hazim,kubernetes-pm,"Hi,
Is there a way to change `logging driver` of containers in the pods to `fluentd`?
I read that kubernetes does not support this: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478>

I know i can change the logging driver on the host docker daemon, but `fluentd` itself would be running as a pod, would such configuration work?",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478
