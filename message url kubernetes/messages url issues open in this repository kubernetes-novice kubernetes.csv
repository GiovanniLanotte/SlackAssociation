hazim,kubernetes-novice,"Hi,
Is there a way to change `logging driver` of containers in the pods to `fluentd`?
I read that kubernetes does not support this: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478>

I know i can change the logging driver on the host docker daemon, but `fluentd` itself would be running as a pod, would such configuration work?",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478
ianlewis,kubernetes-novice,I'm assuming based on <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/28610> that it doesn't do anything smart currently,https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/28610

mhausenblas,kubernetes-novice,"Also, given that ATM runtimes in general can’t update cgroups of running containers, see <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/5774> that means that we’ll always create a new pod, for now",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/5774

shyamjvs,kubernetes-novice,"<@U0Q3RNQBC> Yes, we do have some limitations with services. There's an issue discussing it - <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938>",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938

aveshagarwal,kubernetes-novice,"<@U762JN8RG> i think sig-apps would be faster to get response on this, but may be this issue is related: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/42649>",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/42649
shyamjvs,kubernetes-novice,"&gt; Has anyone tested how many services are supported with the IPVS base in-cluster service load balancing added for 1.8

<@U34FY5S2W> Not that I know of. It might be worth checking with sig-network once. Also see- <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938>",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938

chrishiestand,kubernetes-novice,"This thread <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938> makes it sound like  `iptables-save | grep -E '^-A KUBE-SERVICES' | wc -l` is the factor you care about, being less than 10k? And that in my context you’d want `n` number of nodes times `p` number of ports in the NodePort service to be less than 10k, i.e. `n*p &lt; 10k`.  Or do you only care about `p &lt; 10k` and not about `n` in this case?",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938
