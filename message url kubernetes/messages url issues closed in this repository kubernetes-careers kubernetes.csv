rupsky,kubernetes-careers,I am looking to use Hashicorp Vault as backend for Kuberneters Secretes. Has anyone tried this ?   I found this old open ticket <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/10439> . Not sure if any progress has been made there,https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/10439
ericchiang,kubernetes-careers,"<@U8B9K1ZPG> <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/37822> is a good summary of the state of things. it depends on your provider, which may have some concept of ""public clients"" where the client-secret isn't secret",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/37822

rmt,kubernetes-careers,"<@U69QYR4TV>.. did you have any luck with the etcd open connections issue? <@U6S1GQY1H> and I are colleagues.
 <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/54138/> is the issue we are following, but it appears to be ignored, so we might be alone. Custom deployment on your end?

ApiServers seem to be maintaining the connections to etcd, reconnecting them if etcd goes down. I guess it's a leak of goroutines.",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/54138
puneetguptanitj,kubernetes-careers,"Hi all we are observing a strange behvaiour where rbac/v1 apis are getting available only after ~5-6 mins on api-server start up, had raised an issue <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56899> is anyone else also seeing this? It happens only when we migrate 1.7.7 to 1.8.4. After moving to 1.8.4 even if we restart API server, rbac/v1 apis are immediately available",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56899
