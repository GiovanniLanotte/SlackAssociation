hazim,kubernetes-dev,"Hi,
Is there a way to change `logging driver` of containers in the pods to `fluentd`?
I read that kubernetes does not support this: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478>

I know i can change the logging driver on the host docker daemon, but `fluentd` itself would be running as a pod, would such configuration work?",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478
chrishiestand,kubernetes-dev,"This thread <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938> makes it sound like  `iptables-save | grep -E '^-A KUBE-SERVICES' | wc -l` is the factor you care about, being less than 10k? And that in my context you’d want `n` number of nodes times `p` number of ports in the NodePort service to be less than 10k, i.e. `n*p &lt; 10k`.  Or do you only care about `p &lt; 10k` and not about `n` in this case?",https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/48938
