I am wondering about how the communication design between an operator and its resources should look like. So far we are used to do communication in one direction, which is from the operator to the managed resource. How should it look like in case the managed resource wants to talk back to the operator? E.g. I am thinking about an operator that manages pods in a specific way. In case the pods are restarted or rescheduled I want the operator to know about it. There is now some lifecycle hook support for pods which would be a native entrypoint in this case. I am just wondering what the hook should do. Should it talk to an HTTP API the operator provides or should it update some annotation of the pod itself and the operator has to watch this? I am a bit puzzled on that. WDYT?

This was true till the time we had just one service of type LoadBalancer, but recently some new folks using the cluster deployed another service of type LoadBalancer and it somehow changed the public IP of cluster to the new service's LB IP.

We have an opening for a Kubernetes SME to work with us here at Contino (<http://www.contino.io|www.contino.io>).

12 week initial engagement in Germany. 

In short; his project is about enabling AWS consumption using automation and also helping with Kubernetes PaaS using giantswarm.

A key initiative in achieving efficiency and speed in the SDLC is our customers platform. This is a cloud based 'Platform As A Service' which makes it simpler and faster to develop digital consumer facing applications.

We are engaged as an advisory and delivery partner to support the build of the platforms initiative. This would involve contributing to the build of the platform best practices for automation and operability, but also support on-boarding onto the platform whilst also up-skilling and training our customers staff in parallel.

We are tasked with developing an internal AWS capability and remove the reliance on a third party vendor. We are also tasked with looking to teach our customer to understand AWS best practices, using automation and federated access to controlled environments.

As well as insourcing a best practice AWS implementation, our team have identified the value of software containerisation based on Docker and Kubernetes. The customer will require training and upskilling in containers and Kubernetes as they begin consuming and moving workloads onto the platform.

Sorry for the long winded explanation - but I wanted to give you all a good idea of the project. 

We require someone to start with us prior to the 5th July 2017 - if possible to be UK based consultant willing to travel to Germany.

"kubernetes","kubernetes-careers","U0NQNGVFT","xarg","Hi everyone!

We're looking for somebody in EU to help us respond to possible downtimes of our cluster + improve it by adding better monitoring/alerts, autoscaling, etc..

The reason we're looking for a sysadmin in EU is that half of our customers are there and we are located in San Francisco so if our app goes down when we sleep it's pretty bad for them. They also use our product 8-9h a day so downtimes are really not desirable and is a big problem for us. Enough to look for a freelance sysadmin :slightly_smiling_face:

Here's what I'm thinking you could help us in the first period with:

- Migrate us completely to helm (we've already done it with one our sites), but the main product is still using a combination of replication controllers/services. We want to use helm so that we can have an easier deployment of another staging cluster for example or do tenant isolation.
- Setup a monitoring/alerts for our services. Currently our stack is comprised of a uWSGI python server, flask-socketio, celery workers, rabbitmq cluster and 2 prostgres instances. The alerts should be a bit more based on the load of those services rather than simple up/down state.
- Setup autoscaling for our workers (web and celery) so that they scale according to traffic/rabbitmq available messages in certain queues. At first only k8s autoscaling, then we might launch additional nodes on the cluster too, but that's latter on and not a priority for now.

FYI: we're on GCP using their hosted k8s.

Once we've done all that we'd like to have somebody on pager duty during the day (8h). We're essentially looking to cover the european timezone as much as we can just in case there is something bad going on.
